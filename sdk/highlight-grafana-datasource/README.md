# Grafana data source plugin template

This template is a starting point for building a Data Source Plugin for Grafana.

## What are Grafana data source plugins?

Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, MySQL, and even Datadog. There’s a good chance you can already visualize metrics from the systems you have set up. In some cases, though, you already have an in-house metrics solution that you’d like to add to your Grafana dashboards. Grafana Data Source Plugins enables integrating such solutions with Grafana.

## Getting started

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode and run in watch mode

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Run the tests (using Jest)

   ```bash
   # Runs the tests and watches for changes, requires git init first
   npm run test

   # Exits after running all the tests
   npm run test:ci
   ```

5. Spin up a Grafana instance and run the plugin inside it (using Docker)

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

6. Run the E2E tests (using Cypress)

   ```bash
   # Spins up a Grafana instance first that we tests against
   npm run server

   # Starts the tests
   npm run e2e
   ```

7. Run the linter

   ```bash
   npm run lint

   # or

   npm run lint:fix
   ```

# Distributing your plugin

When distributing a Grafana plugin either within the community or privately the plugin must be signed so the Grafana application can verify its authenticity. This can be done with the `@grafana/sign-plugin` package.

_Note: It's not necessary to sign a plugin during development. The docker development environment that is scaffolded with `@grafana/create-plugin` caters for running the plugin without a signature._

## Initial steps

Before signing a plugin please read the Grafana [plugin publishing and signing criteria](https://grafana.com/legal/plugins/#plugin-publishing-and-signing-criteria) documentation carefully.

`@grafana/create-plugin` has added the necessary commands and workflows to make signing and distributing a plugin via the grafana plugins catalog as straightforward as possible.

Before signing a plugin for the first time please consult the Grafana [plugin signature levels](https://grafana.com/legal/plugins/#what-are-the-different-classifications-of-plugins) documentation to understand the differences between the types of signature level.

1. Create a [Grafana Cloud account](https://grafana.com/signup).
2. Make sure that the first part of the plugin ID matches the slug of your Grafana Cloud account.
   - _You can find the plugin ID in the `plugin.json` file inside your plugin directory. For example, if your account slug is `acmecorp`, you need to prefix the plugin ID with `acmecorp-`._
3. Create a Grafana Cloud API key with the `PluginPublisher` role.
4. Keep a record of this API key as it will be required for signing a plugin

## Signing a plugin

### Using Github actions release workflow

If the plugin is using the github actions supplied with `@grafana/create-plugin` signing a plugin is included out of the box. The [release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) can prepare everything to make submitting your plugin to Grafana as easy as possible. Before being able to sign the plugin however a secret needs adding to the Github repository.

1. Please navigate to "settings > secrets > actions" within your repo to create secrets.
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name the secret "GRAFANA_API_KEY"
4. Paste your Grafana Cloud API key in the Secret field
5. Click "Add secret"

#### Push a version tag

To trigger the workflow we need to push a version tag to github. This can be achieved with the following steps:

1. Run `npm version <major|minor|patch>`
2. Run `git push origin main --follow-tags`
