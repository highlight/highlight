   * Designate any number of Context attributes, or properties within them, as private: that is,
   * their values will not be sent to LaunchDarkly.
   *
   * Each parameter can be a simple attribute name, such as "email". Or, if the first character is
   * a slash, the parameter is interpreted as a slash-delimited path to a property within a JSON
   * object, where the first path component is a Context attribute name and each following
   * component is a nested property name: for example, suppose the attribute "address" had the
   * following JSON object value:
   *
   * ```
   * {"street": {"line1": "abc", "line2": "def"}}
   * ```
   *
   * Using ["/address/street/line1"] in this case would cause the "line1" property to be marked as
   * private. This syntax deliberately resembles JSON Pointer, but other JSON Pointer features
   * such as array indexing are not supported for Private.
   *
   * This action only affects analytics events that involve this particular Context. To mark some
   * (or all) Context attributes as private for all users, use the overall configuration for the
   * SDK.
   * See {@link LDOptions.allAttributesPrivate} and {@link LDOptions.privateAttributes}.
   *
   * The attributes "kind" and "key", and the "_meta" attributes cannot be made private.
   *
   * In this example, firstName is marked as private, but lastName is not:
   *
   * ```
   * const context = {
   *   kind: 'org',
   *   key: 'my-key',
   *   firstName: 'Pierre',
   *   lastName: 'Menard',
   *   _meta: {
   *     privateAttributes: ['firstName'],
   *   }
   * };
   * ```
   *
   * This is a metadata property, rather than an attribute that can be addressed in evaluations:
   * that is, a rule clause that references the attribute name "privateAttributes", will not use
   * this value, but would use a "privateAttributes" attribute set on the context.
