# CloudFormation Templates

This directory contains CloudFormation templates to streamline the process of configuring an AWS account to send observability data to Highlight.

## Deployment

Right now these templates are manually uploaded to S3 when changed. The templates go in the `cloudformation-templates` folder of the `highlight-client-bundle` bucket which is served at `static.highlight.io`.
