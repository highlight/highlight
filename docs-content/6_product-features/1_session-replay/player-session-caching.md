In most cases, the session replayer's local cache allows for a smoother experience when playing back sessions. However, for customers that run a very memory-intensive stack (using canvas recording, or even with lots of changes happening in the dom), the local session player can occosianally slow down the browser tab. We've added a new option to turn off session caching in the highlight dashboard.

You can find this option under Settings > Account Settings > Player Settings.
