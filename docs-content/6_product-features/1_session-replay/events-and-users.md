## Identifying Users & Tracking Events

With session replay, it can be useful to identify the actual users and track actions that they perform. By default, your users in [highlight.io](https://highlight.io) remain anonymous, but we offer the option to identify and track actions with our javascript SDK. Read more in our [SDK Configuration](../../getting-started/3_client-sdk/7_replay-configuration/1_overview.md) guide.
