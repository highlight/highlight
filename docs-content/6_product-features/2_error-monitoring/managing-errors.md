Keeping on top of errors is a challenging effort for any company. Bugs are rarely prioritized and typically don't get attention until a customer writes in about it. Very quickly, errors pile up and it is challenging to distinguish what is signal versus what is noise.

## Resolving errors
Once an error has been fixed, update the status to "Resolved" to remove it from the main Errors view.

## Auto-resolving errors
In your [project settings](https://app.highlight.io/settings), you can auto-resolve errors that haven't been seen for a given time period. If you're trying to manage your error fatigue, we recommend setting this to something low like "7 days". 

## Snoozing errors
If an error is frequently occurring and is causing lots of noise, you can Snooze until a certain time.


## Want additional management features?
