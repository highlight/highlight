## What's this?

In order to make the most out of [highlight.io](https://highlight.io), we suggest instrumenting your frontend & backend so that you can attribute frontend requests with backend errors & logs. See an example below, where you can view an error's details alongside frontend session replay, allowing you to get the full context you need.

Below, we detail the requirements to get this working as well how to troubleshoot.

## How can I start using this?

### Install the client bundle

If you haven't already, you need to install our client javascript bundle in the framework of your choice. Get started below:
<DocsCardGroup>
<DocsCard title="Getting Started (Client)" href="./1_overview.md">
{"Install the `highlight.run` client bundle in your app."}
</DocsCard>
</DocsCardGroup>

### Turn on `tracingOrigins`

Set the `tracingOrigins` option to an array of patterns matching the location of your backend. You may also simply specify `true`, which will default `tracingOrigins` to all subdomains/domains of the url for your frontend app.

```javascript
H.init("<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>", {
	tracingOrigins: ['localhost', 'example.myapp.com/backend'],
    ...
});
```

### Turn on `networkRecording`

```javascript
H.init("<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>", {
	networkRecording: {
		enabled: true,
		recordHeadersAndBody: true,
	},
	...
});
```

## Backend Changes

Backend changes are dependent on the underlying language/framework used on the server-side codebase. All you need to add is a middleware and code to capture errors.

Below are solutions for what we support today. If you'd like us to support a new framework, feel free to shoot us a message at [support@highlight.io](mailto:support@highlight.io) or drop us a note in our [discord](https://discord.gg/yxaXEAqgwN).

- [JS Backend Integration](4_backend-sdk/js)

- [Python Backend Integration](4_backend-sdk/python)

## Troubleshooting

1.  Ensure `tracingOrigins` and `networkRecording` are properly set.

2.  Ensure your backend has `CORS` configured for your frontend hostname, explicitely allowing header `x-highlight-request`.

3.  For debugging the backend sdk of your choice, in order to debug, we suggest enabling verbose logging. For example, in go, add `highlight.SetDebugMode(myLogger)`

4.  If all else fails, please send us an email at support@highlight.io or join the #support channel on our [discord](https://discord.gg/yxaXEAqgwN).
