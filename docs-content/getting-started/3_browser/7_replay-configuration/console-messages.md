Highlight out of the box shows you the console messages that were logged during a session.

```hint
Console messages are not recorded on `localhost` because Highlight emits debug messages which we prefer not to flood your environment with.
```

## Configuration

- Disabling console recording can be configured with `disableConsoleRecording`.

- You can specify which console methods to record with `consoleMethodsToRecord`.

See [H.init()](../../../sdk/client.md#Hinit) for more information.
