The Node SDK supports auto-instrumentation tracing for Next.js and many libraries supported by OpenTelementry, while also allowing you to create manual traces. If there is a framework or library that would be helpful for Highlight to support tracing out of the box, reach out to us in our [discord community](https://highlight.io/community) or open a PR and let us know!
