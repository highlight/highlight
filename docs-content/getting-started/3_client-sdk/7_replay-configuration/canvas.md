## Canvas Recording

Highlight by default does not record the contents of `<canvas>` elements. This is usually why the session replay has blank areas where those areas should be `<canvas>` elements. We provide experimental recording of `<canvas>` contents.

Enable canvas recording by configuring [H.init()](../../../sdk/client.md#Hinit) in the following way:

```javascript
H.init('YOUR_PROJECT_ID', {
  enableCanvasRecording: true,
  samplingStrategy: {
    canvas: 15,
    canvasQuality: 'low',
    canvasMaxSnapshotDimension: 480,
  },
})
```

`samplingStrategy.canvas` is the frame per second rate used to record the HTML canvas. We recommend a value < 5 to ensure recording performance is not impacted at high resolutions.

`samplingStrategy.canvasQuality`: 'pixelated' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'. This value represents the image compression quality and will affect the size of the canvas images uploaded.

`samplingStrategy.canvasMaxSnapshotDimension`: max recording resolution of the largest dimension of the canvas.

Snapshotting at full resolution and high FPS can produce too much data for our client to upload on devices with low upload bandwidth. We've found that with a safe assumption of upload speed @, 1 MB/s I can support the above snapshotting settings without a problem at 480p 15 fps.

Even though this feature is experimental, it should not have any impact on your application. We've recently changed our uploading client to use browser web-workers to ensure that data serialization cannot block the rendering of your application. If you run into any issues please let us know!

## WebGL Recording

In the same vain, Highlight is able to record websites that use WebGL. Recording WebGL is disabled by default. To enable WebGL recording, enable canvas recording by following the instructions for [Canvas](./canvas.md) recording.

## Caveats

For both WebGL and canvas recording, [Privacy](../../../general/6_product-features/1_session-replay/privacy.md) controls do not apply to canvas recording right now.
