Highlight out of the box shows you all the network requests durations, response codes, and sizes for a session. If you'd like more data such as the headers and bodies, you can enable recording of network requests and responses by setting `networkRecording.recordHeadersAndBody` (see [NetworkRecordingOptions](../../../sdk/client.md#Hinit)) to `true` when initializing Highlight.

Highlight monkey patches `XmlHttpRequest` and `fetch` to record data from your app's requests/responses including status codes, headers, and bodies.

## Privacy

Out of the box, Highlight will not record known headers that contain secrets. Those headers are:
\- `Authorization`
\- `Cookie`
\- `Proxy-Authorization`

If you have other headers that you would like to redact then you can set `networkRecording.networkHeadersToRedact`.

## Recording Headers and Bodies

Highlight can also record the request/response headers and bodies. You'll be able to see the headers and bodies by clicking on any XHR or Fetch requests in the session Developer Tools.

```typescript
H.init('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>', {
  networkRecording: {
    enabled: true,
    recordHeadersAndBody: true,
  },
})
```

## Redacting URLs

You may have APIs that you know will always return secrets in the headers, body, or both. In this case, you can choose URLs to redact from. If a URL matches one of the URLs you specify, the header and body will not be recorded.

```typescript
H.init('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>', {
  networkRecording: true,
  urlBlocklist: [
    'https://salted-passwords.com',
    'https://www.googleapis.com/identitytoolkit',
    'https://securetoken.googleapis.com',
  ],
})
```

Out of the box, Highlight will not record these URLs:
\- `https://www.googleapis.com/identitytoolkit`
\- `https://securetoken.googleapis.com`

## Redacting Headers and Bodies

If you are dealing with sensitive data or want to go the allowlist approach then you can configure `networkRecording.headerKeysToRecord` and `networkRecording.bodyKeysToRecord`. Using these 2 configs, you'll be able to explicitly define which header/body keys to record.

This configuration is only available for `highlight.run` versions newer than `4.1.0`.

## API

See [NetworkRecordingOptions](../../../sdk/client.md) for more information on how to configure network recording.
