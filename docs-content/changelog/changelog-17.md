## New setup page just dropped!
We just launched a new setup page that makes it easier to get started with [highlight.io](https://highlight.io). Check it out at [https://app.highlight.io/setup](https://app.highlight.io/setup).

## Ability to turn off session caching for high-memory playback.
For customers that run a very memory-intensive stack (using canvas recording, or even with lots of changes happening in the dom), the local session player can occosianally slow down the browser tab. We've added a new option to the [highlight.io](https://highlight.io) config to turn off session caching. See docs [here](../6_product-features/1_session-replay/player-session-caching.md).

## Setting up alerts no longer require a slack connection.
Before this change, there was a bug that made it difficult to set up alerts without a slack channel. This is no longer the case.
