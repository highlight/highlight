[highlight.io](https://highlight.io) has first-party support for enhancing minified stacktraces in javacript. We also support options for sending sourcemaps to us in the case that your sourcemaps aren't public. Read more about it in our [getting started doc](../../../getting-started/3_client-sdk/7_replay-configuration/sourcemaps.md)
