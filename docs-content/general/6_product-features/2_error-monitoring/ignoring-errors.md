[highlight.io](https://highlight.io) allows you to ignore errors that you don't want to see in your error monitoring dashboard. This is useful for errors that you know are not relevant to your application, or for errors that you know are not actionable.

There are several options for ignoring errors, all of which can be found in your [project settings](https://app.highlight.io/settings). Details on each option are below.

## Ignore errors emmitted by chrome extensions
If your users are using chrome extensions, you may see errors that are not relevant to your application. You can ignore these errors by checking the "Filter out errors thrown by chrome extensions" box in your project settings.

## Ignore errors by Regex on the error body
Coming soon.
