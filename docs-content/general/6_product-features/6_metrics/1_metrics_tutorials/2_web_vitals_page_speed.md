## Overview

This tutorial shows you how to optimize your website's web vitals and page speed for an enhanced user experience. By following this guide, you'll learn to monitor and improve key performance indicators that directly impact your site's usability and search engine rankings.

## Step-by-step Guide

### 1. Access Web Vitals Metrics

Begin by navigating to the Metrics dashboard in your highlight.io account. Here, you'll find a wealth of data about your website's performance. Familiarize yourself with the layout and available options to make the most of these powerful tools.

### 2. Set Up Page Speed Monitoring

Create a new graph specifically for page load times. This will give you a clear visual representation of your site's speed performance. Configure the graph to show data for key pages, allowing you to identify problem areas quickly.

### 3. Analyze Core Web Vitals

Focus on the three Core Web Vitals: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). These metrics are crucial for understanding your site's performance from a user's perspective. Monitor them closely to identify areas for improvement.

### 4. Identify Performance Issues

Use the available filters to isolate problematic pages or user segments. Look for patterns in poor performance, such as slow load times on specific devices or browsers. This targeted approach will help you prioritize your optimization efforts.

### 5. Implement Optimizations

Address the issues highlighted by your metrics. This might involve optimizing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript, or implementing lazy loading. Focus on quick wins that can provide immediate improvement to your site's performance.

### 6. Monitor Progress and Set Goals

Set up before/after comparisons to track the impact of your optimizations. Establish benchmarks for each web vital and create alerts for when metrics fall below your targets. This proactive approach will help you maintain high performance over time.

By consistently following this process, you'll be able to effectively monitor and improve your website's web vitals and page speed. This will result in a better user experience, improved search engine rankings, and ultimately, a more successful online presence.
