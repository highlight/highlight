Metrics are representations of your sessions, errors, logs, and traces that you can graph, analyze, and monitor. When understanding your business or application, the reality is that a lot of the data you need is already in highlight.io.

You can find our metrics product at [app.highlight.io/metrics](https://app.highlight.io/metrics).
