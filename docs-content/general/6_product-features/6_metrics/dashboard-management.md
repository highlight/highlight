## Get Started

At [app.highlight.io/metrics](https://app.highlight.io/metrics), there is an overview of all dashboards in your project, with recently created dashboards last. If your project has many dashboards, you can filter on their name using the search functionality.

By default, all projects have an "Insights" dashboard automatically created to show useful graphs and showcase many of the highlight.io metrics features.
