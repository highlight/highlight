Due to the nature of Highlight's core product, we keep privacy a top priority. [highlight.io](https://highlight.io) has the necessary [compliance measures](../../4_company/compliance-and-security.md) in place to support your business and beyond that, we've built several ways to redact/mask certain DOM elements while still preserving the structure of your DOM recording. It is important to note that for all of our solutions, all data is sanitized on the client, so sensitive data never reaches our servers/platform. Read more about configuring privacy settings in our [SDK Configuration](../../../getting-started/3_client-sdk/7_replay-configuration/1_overview.md) section.
