In [highlight.io](https://highlight.io), you can search for a session by any of the data you send us (via the SDK)
throughout a session. The data you send us can be in the form of:

- [track](../../../getting-started/3_client-sdk/7_replay-configuration/tracking-events.md) calls

- [identify](../../../getting-started/3_client-sdk/7_replay-configuration/identifying-sessions.md) calls

- click data

This is done using [search query](../../6_product-features/3_general-features/search.md), and we cover how
search/instrumentation for each type of these queries works below.

## Searching for sessions

For general information on searching sessions, check out our [Search docs](../../6_product-features/3_general-features/search.md).

## Default search

By default, Highlight will show completed sessions that have been fully processed, `completed=true`. For newer
projects with less sessions, Highlight will show all sessions, and provide an example of how to use the search
query, `completed=(true or false)`.

## Default key

The default key for session search searches across multiple attributes. These columns include the user's identifier and
location. This could be the user's `email`, `device_id`, or given `identifier`,  as well as their `city` or `country`.

For example, if you enter an expression without a key (`highlight`) it will be used as the key for the following expression.

```
email=*highlight* OR city=*highlight*
```

## Track Searching
For track calls, you can search for sessions based on the properties that you gave to the track method. For example,
if you want to filter sessions out by the value of a tracked feature toggle, `FeatureFlag-Analytics`, then you can
use the the following query:

```
FeatureFlag-Analytics=true
```

## Identify Searching
For identify calls, you can search for sessions based on the properties that have a name of `identifier`, and the
value corresponds to the value sent to the first argument of `H.init` (see [here](../../../sdk/client.md)). This
looks like the following query:

```
identifier=spencer@highlight.io
```

## Searching by User Clicks

When using Highlight, you might be interested in querying for sessions where a user clicked a certain HTML element.
Highlight records users' clicks on the page as two queryable properties: `clickSelector` and `clickInnerText`.

- `clickSelector` is the HTML Element's target's selector, concatinating the element's `tag`, `id ` and `class` values.

- `clickTextContent `is the HTML Element's target's `textContent` property. Only the first 2000 characters are sent.

You can then use the session filters to search for text in the two fields. An example of these queries are:

```
clickSelector=svg
clickTextContent="Last 30 days"
```

## Searching by Visited URL

You can also search for sessions based on the URL that the user visited. This is useful if you want to search for
sessions where a user visited a certain page on your site.

To perform this search, you can use the `visit-url` filter. An example of this query is:

```
visited-url="https://app.highlight.io/"
```

Since many urls contains the special characters, `:` and `=`, you can wrap the value in quotations to avoid any errors.

And like all of our filters, you can use contains, `=**`, and matches, `=//`, to help acheive the query you need. For
example, to get all sessions that visited the sessions page, we can use the following queries:

```
visited-url=*sessions*
visited-url=/.+\d/sessions.+/
```

## Autoinjected attributes

By default, Highlight's SDKs will autoinject attributes to provide additional context to help with searching for sessions.

## Helpful tips

Use the `completed=false` to view live sessions.

Create a new `sample` of sessions by clicking "New Random Seed" for the sample's values.

Currently, length and active length are not supported by time suffixes, but this functionality is coming soon.
