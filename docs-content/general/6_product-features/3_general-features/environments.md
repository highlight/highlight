Environments can be assigned to sessions and errors by setting the environment option in [H.init()](../../../sdk/client.md#Hinit). With the assignment, you can know search and filter sessions and errors based on the environment they come from.

Environments are also used to determine whether [Alerts](../3_general-features/alerts.md) are created.

## Example

```typescript
H.init('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>', {
  environment: process.env.ENVIRONMENT,
})
```
