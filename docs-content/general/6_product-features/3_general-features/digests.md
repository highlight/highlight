Highlight Digests are a weekly email summary of interesting sessions, errors, and user activity.

## Getting Started

You don't have to do anything to start receiving digests. If your project has 50+ sessions recorded in the past week, a digest will automatically be emailed to all workspace members. Digests are sent every Monday around 9am PST.

## Features
