When you enable the GitHub integration, Highlight will allow creating Issues from the session replay and errors viewer. Track bugs or enhancements for your app as you triage frontend and backend errors or watch your users' replays. Enhance backend error stacktraces with GitHub's file context.

To get started, go to the [integrations](https://app.highlight.io/integrations) and click the "Connect" button in the GitHub section.

## Features

1.  [Comments](../6_product-features/3_general-features/comments.md) can create a GitHub issue filled out with the body of the comment and link back to the Session.

2.  [Grouping Errors](../6_product-features/2_error-monitoring/grouping-errors.md) shows a shortcut to create a GitHub issue pre-populated with the error linking to the full context of how the error occurred.

3.  [Enhance Error Stacktraces](../6_product-features/2_error-monitoring/enhancing-errors-with-github.md) by using context fetched from files on GitHub.
