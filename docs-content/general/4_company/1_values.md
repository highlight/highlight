## Overview

This doc acts as a reference for our values at highlight.io, which includes how we work and we build things. If you'd like to learn more about our product philosophy, check [this doc](./product-philosophy.md).

Our mission is to support developers (like you) to ship with confidence. We do this by giving you the tools you need to **uncover, resolve, and prevent** issues in your web app.

With everything we build, we maintain an unwavering promise to use open source technologies so that you and your team don't have a dependency on our hosted offerings. 

## We build in public.

We strive to build in public in every way we can. This means sharing our roadmap, product specs, and company strategy. We see this as giving you all the more reason to consider joining us in [building highlight](https://careers.highlight.run).

## We execute quickly and fail fast.

Given that most of the things we build are zero to one, there's often no better way to learn than to build. It's hard to predict how something will scale or be interacted w/ without building something and getting early feedback. With this philosophy, however, its easy to ship low quality work. To address this, we always prefer to "cut scope, not quality", i.e. build out a few, very polished modules rather than many half-baked ones.

## ABC: Always be chilling....

Though working at highlight.io can be fast-paced at times, we keep it chill. This means aking time for social events, taking time off, and learning about each other beyond just work. We're all humans, and we all have lives outside of work.
