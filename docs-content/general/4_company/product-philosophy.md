## Overview

This doc acts as a reference for our product philosophy at highlight.io, or to be more exact, how we think about what we build (not necessarily how we build it). It acts as a way for our team to prioritize work as well as educating the public on where we're headed. Sharing this type of content aligns with our values to [build in public](./1_values.md#we-build-in-public) and we hope to continue sharing more in this space.

## Cohesion

![](/images/Cohesion720.gif)

Our product philosophy at highlight.io is centered around the concept of "cohesion", or the idea that we're focused on building a tightly coupled suite of tools that helps developers ship software with confidence.

Prior to working on highlight.io, we all worked at several tech companies of varying sizes, and had first-hand experience trying to stitch together numerous tools to reproduce bugs. It wasn't uncommon that we had to do something like: log into Sentry to see a stacktrace, log into Splunk to query logs, and after investigating with even more tools, give up and log in "as the user" to try and reproduce the issue.

## The Vision

With highlight.io, we're changing that by building monitoring software that "wraps" your infrastructure and application, and we do ALL the work to stitch everything together. Our long-term goal is that you can trace everything from a button click to a server-side regression with little to no effort.

Now, if you were to ask, "but that's a lot to build, no?" we would reply with ["Yes, give us a hand?"](https://careers.highlight.run).
