## Avoiding Cookie Consent (disabling localStorage)

If you're using the highlight.io browser client and would like to avoid requesting cookie consent from your users,
you can pass the `storageMode: 'sessionStorage'` option to `H.init` to make sure that highlight will not persist
any data in `window.localStorage`. This will mean that if a user leaves your site and returns later, a new
highlight recording will start regardless of the time since they left, 
since we will not persist any metadata in the browser.
