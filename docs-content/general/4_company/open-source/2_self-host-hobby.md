## Pricing

Pricing for our self-hosted enterprise deployment starts at $3k / month. Contact us at jay@highlight.io, or message us [on discord](https://community.highlight.io) to get in touch.

# Limitations

We don't recommend hosting Highlight yourself if you have more than 10k monthly sessions or 50k monthly errors. The infrastructure configuration in the docker compose is not meant to scale beyond a small number of sessions, and isn't resilient to an outage or version upgrades.

That being said, if the benefits of self hosting Highlight are signficant enough, you may want to consider an enterprise deployment (see [our Enterprise Self Hosted Docs](./3_self-host-enterprise.md)).

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to [reach out](https://community.highlight.io)!
