### Self Hosted Deployment Options

We have multiple flexible options for running highlight on your own infrastructure. While the simplest
way to get going is our docker compose single deploy, we support complex deployments that provide better scalability and availability. 

- **Docker Compose**: Deploy Highlight on a single VM for a simpler deploy.
- **Kubernetes Helm Chart**: Deploy Highlight on your kubernetes cluster with our clustered HA Helm deploy.
- **CloudFormation / Terraform / Pulumi**: Deploy Highlight on your cloud provider of choice.
