This doc acts as a reference for our product philosophy at highlight.io, or to be more exact, how we think about what we build (not necessarily how we build it). It acts a way for our team to prioritize work, but also educate the public on where we're headed. Sharing this type of content aligns with our values to [build in public](./1_values.md#we-build-in-public) and we hope to continue sharing more in this space.

Our product philsophy at highlight.io is centered around the concept of "cohesion", or the idea that we're focused on building  a tightly coupled suite of tools that helps developers ship software with confidence.

Prior to working on highlight.io, we all worked at several tech companies of varying sizes, and had first-hand experience trying to stich together numerous tools to reproduce bugs. It wasn't uncommon that we had to, for e.g., login to Sentry to see a stacktrace, log into Splunk to query logs, and after loads more tools, finally succumb to having to login "as the user" to try and reproduce the issue.

With highlight.io, we're trying to change that. By building monitoring software that "wraps" your infrastructure and application. Our long-term goal is that you can see the full picture of what's happening in your app, whether it be logs, errors, session replay and more, and we do the work to associate all of these resources so that you can ship w/ confidence.

Now, you may ask, "but that's a lot to build, no?". And we'd reply with "Yep, you're right.". It's definitely ambitious. But that's why its exciting.
