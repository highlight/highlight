title: Our Product Philsophy

## Overview 

This doc acts as a reference for our product philosophy at highlight.io, or to be more exact, how we think about what we build (not necessarily how we build it). It acts as a way for our team to prioritize work, but also educate the public on where we're headed. Sharing this type of content aligns with our values to [build in public](./1_values.md#we-build-in-public) and we hope to continue sharing more in this space.

## Cohesion

Our product philsophy at highlight.io is centered around the concept of "cohesion", or the idea that we're focused on building a tightly coupled suite of tools that helps developers ship software with confidence.

Prior to working on highlight.io, we all worked at several tech companies of varying sizes, and had first-hand experience trying to stich together numerous tools to reproduce bugs. It wasn't uncommon that we had to, for e.g., login to Sentry to see a stacktrace, log into Splunk to query logs, and after investigating with even more tools, give up and log in "as the user" to try and reproduce the issue.

## The Vision

With highlight.io, we're trying to change that by building monitoring software that "wraps" your infrastructure and application, and ideally, we do ALL the work to stitch together everything. Our long-term goal is that you can trace everything from a button click to a server-side regression with little to no effort.

Now, if you were to ask, "but that's a lot to build, no?" we would reply with "Yes, give us a hand?": [careers.highlight.run](https://careers.highlight.run).
