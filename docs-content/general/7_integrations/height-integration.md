When you enable the Height integration, Highlight will allow creating Tasks from the session replay and errors viewer. Track bugs or enhancements for your app as you triage frontend and backend errors or watch your users' replays.

To get started, go to the [integrations](https://app.highlight.io/integrations) and click the "Connect" button in the Height section.

## Features

1.  [Comments](../6_product-features/3_general-features/comments.md) can create a Height task filled out with the body of the comment and link back to the Session.

2.  [Grouping Errors](../6_product-features/2_error-monitoring/grouping-errors.md) shows a shortcut to create a Height task pre-populated with the error linking to the full context of how the error occurred.
