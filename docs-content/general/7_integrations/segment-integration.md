```hint
We are currently working with Segment on an official integration where you can enable, configure, and send data to Highlight. If you'd like to use this, then [upvote this feature request](https://highlight.canny.io/feature-requests/p/official-segment-integration).
```

## Enabling the Segment Integration

```javascript
H.init('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>', {
  enableSegmentIntegration: true,
})
```

Segment's `identify()` calls will now start forwarding to Highlight.

## Enabling Track data forwarding

To forward `analytics.track()` calls to Highlight, you will need to use the `HighlightSegmentMiddleware`. This is available in the `highlight.run` package starting in version `2.10.0`.

```javascript
import { H, HighlightSegmentMiddleware } from 'highlight.run'

H.init('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>', {
  enableSegmentIntegration: true,
})
analytics.addSourceMiddleware(HighlightSegmentMiddleware)
```
