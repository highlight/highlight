## Contributing a new SDK:

Check out our new docs on [adding an SDK](../4_company/open-source/contributing/adding-an-sdk.md). We're powered by opentelemetry, so adding something for your framework shouldn't be too tough; we're also down to work with you on it!

## Better Doc Search

Thanks to our friends at Algolia, search in our docs is much smoother now! Give it a try with CMD+K.
