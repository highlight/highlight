## Remix SDK at v0

Remix works great with Highlight. It was surprisingly easy to instrument.

Check out our [@highlight-run/remix docs](https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/fullstack-frameworks/remix) for an easy walkthrough.

## Canvas Manual Snapshotting

[@Vadman97](https://github.com/Vadman97) solved a long-standing issue with WebGL double buffering. The WebGL memory would render a transparent image even though the GPU was rending the image correctly. This caused missing images in Session Replay.

Take full control over your Canvas snapshots with the [manual snapshotting docs](https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/client-sdk/replay-configuration/canvas#manual-snapshotting)

## Set "Service Name" and "Service Version" with the Python and Go SDKs

We've added `service_name` and `service_version` parameters to the [Python SDK](https://www.highlight.io/docs/sdk/python#servicename) and the [Go SDK](https://www.highlight.io/docs/sdk/go#highlightStart).

These params make logs much more searchable.

#### Repaired scrolling in metadata

Shout out to to Kalkidan Betreâ€”[@kalibetre](https://github.com/kalibetre) on GitHubâ€”for their open source contribution. They noticed that our Metadata window on the Session Replay screen wasn't scrolling correctly, and they sent in a pull request to fix it.

Thanks Kalkidan!
