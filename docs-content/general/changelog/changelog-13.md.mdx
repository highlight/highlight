## We launched on HackerNews

We launched on hackernews a few days ago, and gained surpassed 1.5k github stars!!! Check out our [launch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34897645) and if you haven't already, check us out on [github](https://github.com/highlight/highlight).

## Contributing a new SDK:

Interested in adding a new SDK for your for your backend (that isn't support [here](../../getting-started/1_overview.md))? Check out our new docs on [adding an SDK](../4_company/open-source/contributing/adding-an-sdk.md). We're powered by opentelemetry, so adding something for your framework shouldn't be too tough; we're also down to work with you on it!

## Better Doc Search

Thanks to our friends at Algolia, search in our docs is much smoother now! Give it a try with CMD+K.

## New SDKs!!

We've shipped even more SDKS this week:

[Go Fiber](../../getting-started/4_backend-sdk/go.md)

[Python Fast API](../../getting-started/4_backend-sdk/05_python/1_overview.md)
