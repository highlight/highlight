## Open Source!

highlight.io is open source at [https://github.com/highlight/highlight](https://github.com/highlight/highlight) (would appreciate a star ‚≠êÔ∏è). We've also got lots of updates to share on this front as we grow, so stay tuned!

## Changing the status of an error is now instant!

We're now using `optimisticResponses` in apollo to update the state of an error. When you change the status, this now happens instantly in the UI ü§Ø.
