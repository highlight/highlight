## Goals

> A short paragraph or bullet list that quickly explains what we’re trying to build.

## User Feedback

> If this feature is driven by user feedback, link out examples.*

## Competitor Analysis

> While we want to build out a better version of what’s out there, providing competitor examples can illustrate the story better.

## Pricing

> How should we monetize this feature while also minimizing friction to adoption.

## What we are building

> What metrics will we be monitoring to know the project is completed and producing the desired result?

## What are we not building

> Shoot for an MVP and iteratively build from there. Flag things that may be out of scope.
