# Welcome [@github-new-hire-username](https://github.com/github-new-hire-username) ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Highlight [@github-new-hire-username](https://github.com/github-new-hire-username)! We're thrilled to have you join us.
Recently, our company went [open source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34897645) and we are [building our work in public](https://www.highlight.io/docs/general/company/values#we-build-in-public). 

Your onboarding buddy is [@github-onboarding-buddy-username](https://github.com/github-onboarding-buddy-username) and they'll walk you through your next couple weeks.

### Dogfooding exercise

At Highlight, we use our product on ourselves and it's important 

- Sign up for Highlight (app.highlight.io) with your personal email.
- Set up a frontend app in your framework of choice and integrate Highlight [using our docs](https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/overview) (or the setup page) to record a session.
- Set up a backend app in a language/framework of your choice and record errors and logs.
- Give us feedback on the process.
    - Where did you experience friction?
    - Were the docs incorrect anywhere?
    - Were the docs easy to navigate?
    - Was the API spec in the expected style to the language? (e.g. naming made sense or matched the stylistic nature of the language).
