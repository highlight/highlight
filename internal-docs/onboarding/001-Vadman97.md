# Welcome [@Vadman97](https://github.com/Vadman97) ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Highlight [@Vadman97](https://github.com/Vadman97)! We're thrilled to have you join us.
Recently, our company went [open source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34897645) and we are [building our work in public](https://www.highlight.io/docs/general/company/values#we-build-in-public).

Your onboarding buddy is [@et](https://github.com/et) and they'll walk you through your next couple weeks.

## Feedback

Highlight is a fast moving start up that is constantly evolving.

If you see something you think should be changed, feel empowered to make the change through a pull request, a public slack channel, or a meeting. 

# Timeline

## Ahead of day one

Prior to joining Highlight, ensure you have ordered a laptop that will arrive before your first day (work with your onboarding buddy to figure this out).

## Week one

Your onboarding buddy will help you through the following tasks over your first week but prioritize getting to know the team and understanding the product over delivering work. 

- [ ] https://github.com/highlight/highlight/issues/4933

### Day one

* Have informal 1-1s with everyone on the team (or have them scheduled)
* Get your [development environment](https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/self-host/self-hosted-hobby-guide) set up
* Pick up one of the tasks above.

### Day two (dogfooding exercise)

- Start at Highlight's [homepage](https://www.highlight.io/), find the sign up page to sign up with your personal email.
- Set up a frontend app in your framework of choice and integrate Highlight [using our docs](https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/overview) (or the setup page) to record a session.
- Set up a backend app in a language/framework of your choice and record errors and logs.
- Give us feedback on the process.
    - Where did you experience friction?
    - Were the docs incorrect anywhere?
    - Were the docs easy to navigate?
    - Was the API spec in the expected style to the language? (e.g. naming made sense or matched the stylistic nature of the language).

## Week two

Set up pairing with each member of the team on the following tasks:

- [ ] https://github.com/highlight/highlight/issues/4764 with [@ccschmitz](https://github.com/ccschmitz)
- [ ] https://github.com/highlight/highlight/issues/4837 with [@mayberryzane](https://github.com/mayberryzane)
