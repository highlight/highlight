# Welcome [@deltaepsilon](https://github.com/deltaepsilon) 👋

Welcome to Highlight [@deltaepsilon](https://github.com/deltaepsilon)! We're thrilled to have you join us.

We are an [open source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34897645) company and one of our core values is [building in public](https://www.highlight.io/docs/general/company/values#we-build-in-public) -- that also includes onboarding 🎉

Your onboarding buddy is [@Vadman97](https://github.com/Vadman97) for week one and [@et](https://github.com/et) for week two and beyond.

## Feedback

Highlight is a fast moving start up that is constantly evolving.

If you see something you think should be changed, feel empowered to propose changes through a pull request, a public slack channel, or a meeting. 

# Timeline

## Ahead of day one

Prior to joining Highlight, ensure you have ordered a laptop that will arrive before your first day and that you have payroll and insurance set up (your onboarding buddy will help you figure this out).

## Week one

Your onboarding buddy will help you through the following tasks over your first week but prioritize getting to know the team and understanding the product over delivering work. 

- [ ] https://github.com/highlight/highlight/issues/3951
    - 
- [ ] https://github.com/highlight/highlight/issues/4774

### Day one

* Have informal 1-1s with everyone on the team (or have them scheduled)
* Get your [development environment](https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/self-host/self-hosted-hobby-guide) set up
* Pick up one of the tasks above.

### Day two (dogfooding exercise)

- Start at Highlight's [homepage](https://www.highlight.io/), find the sign up page to sign up with your personal email.
- Set up a frontend app in your framework of choice and integrate Highlight [using our docs](https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/overview) (or the setup page) to record a session.
- Set up a backend app in a language/framework of your choice and record errors and logs.
- Give us feedback on the process.
    - Where did you experience friction?
    - Were the docs incorrect anywhere?
    - Were the docs easy to navigate?
    - Was the API spec in the expected style to the language? (e.g. naming made sense or matched the stylistic nature of the language).

## Week two

Set up pairing with each member of the team on the following tasks:

- [ ] https://github.com/highlight/highlight/issues/4790 with [@et](https://github.com/et)
- [ ] https://github.com/highlight/highlight/issues/4764 with [@et](https://github.com/et) and [@julian-highlight](https://github.com/julian-highlight)
- [ ] https://github.com/highlight/highlight/issues/4477 with [@ccschmitz](https://github.com/ccschmitz)
- [ ] https://github.com/highlight/highlight/issues/4886 with [@mayberryzane](https://github.com/mayberryzane)

## Week three

At this point, you should be getting more comfortable with the team and our codebase. While most of us are full stack engineers, some people gravitate towards different parts of the stack. But success at Highlight doesn't have to be driven by writing code -- there are many opportunities to wear different hats here. Work with your onboarding buddy to understand how you can feel most fulfilled working at Highlight.

## Beyond week three

Once you feel like you are fully spun up, open up a pull request to delete your onboarding document. Feel free to propose any changes to the template to improve the experience for the next hire!
