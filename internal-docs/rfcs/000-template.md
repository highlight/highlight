## Summary

> A short paragraph or bullet list that quickly explains what you're trying to do.

## Motivation

> What motivates this proposal and why is it important?

## Proposed Implementation

> This is the core of your proposal, and its purpose is to help you think through the problem because [writing is thinking](https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/writing-is-thinking-an-annotated-twitter-thread-2a75fe07fade).

> Consider:

- *using diagrams to help illustrate your ideas.*
- *including code examples if you're proposing an interface or system contract.*
- *linking to project briefs or wireframes that are relevant.*

## Database modeling

> Will this proposal require a database model? Will it modify an existing database model? If so, spec out your changes.

> Consider:

- *Can we avoid nullable types? (null fields lead to buggier code since pointers can be nil)*
- *Do we need to backfill data?*

## Success Metrics

> What metrics will we be monitoring to know the project is completed and producing the desired result?

## Drawbacks

> Are there any reasons why we should not do this? Here we aim to evaluate risk and check ourselves.

## Alternatives

> What are other ways of achieving the same outcome?

## Open Questions

> Document any open questions that need to be answered.

## Rollout + Adoption

> How will this change be rolled out and adopted across the team + codebase? Consider adding list showing sequencing of different deliverables.

## Tasks

> Document any open action items to move this forward.
