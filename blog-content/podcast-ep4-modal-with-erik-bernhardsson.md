## Serverless for your GPU workloads

Erik Bernhardsson is the founder of [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/), a serverless compute platform specializing in high-performance workloads running on both CPUs and GPUs.

Modal.com focuses on nearly instant code deploys, enabling developers to write locally and run their code on Modal.com's cloud GPUs. Sub-second code deploys enable super fast feedback looks, keeping developers productive throughout their day.

## Generative AI inference in the cloud

Data pipelines are complex, and Kubernetes is often a terrible fit.

Modal simplifies complex pipelines and GPU-intensive work like AI inference. Modal is multi-cloud, so while they don't own the hardware, they orchestrate and manage it for your team, minimizing fees for idle time and maximizing productivity.
