## Day 4: Cohesion!

Checkout our [launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Y3q32Ll0Y) or keep reading!

Day 4 is all about ‘cohesion’, or how the Highlight product connects each and every resource. If you’re curious and want to read more, we’ve written a lot about this when it comes to our [product philosophy](https://www.highlight.io/docs/general/company/product-philosophy#cohesion). 

With these new cohesion changes, we’re reducing the number of clicks it takes to jump from, say, a session reply to a log, which helps you keep context when you’re investigating an issue.

If you’re interested in setting up a more ‘connected’ set up when it comes to your highlight resources, check out our [docs](https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/frontend-backend-mapping), or feel free to reach out to us in [discord](https://highlight.io/community).
