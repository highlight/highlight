## Turso origins
What began as an effort to enhance the developer experience around SQLite evolved into a full-fledged database company, as the open-source fork Glauber and his co-founder created, called libSQL, rapidly gained traction. Faced with the choice of continuing their original ChiselStrike project or pivoting to focus on the database, Glauber and team ultimately decided to go all-in on building Turso - a managed service built atop their open-source work.

## Developing a Global Presence with Turso
As Turso has grown, Glauber and his team have focused on making the database highly accessible and scalable for modern, distributed applications. The ability to instantly spin up databases with multi-region replication is a key selling point, as is the serverless, pay-as-you-go pricing model. Glauber also discussed Turso's efforts to build a global community, including an upcoming event in Brazil called [#brazilmentioned](https://www.brazilmentioned.com) that will feature the popular developer influencer The Primeagen.
