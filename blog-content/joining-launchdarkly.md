It’s an exciting day for Highlight as we are announcing some awesome news: 
[we’re joining forces with LaunchDarkly!](http://launchdarkly.com/blog/welcome-highlight-to-launchdarkly)

Over the past year, we’ve gotten to know the team at LaunchDarkly, and it quickly became clear that we share a common
vision — one where developers have the tools they need to ship with confidence and speed.

What’s really exciting is that LaunchDarkly has already had a lot of success
with [guarded rollouts](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts), and very soon,
Highlight will be a first-party observability solution within LaunchDarkly, feeding directly into these Guarded
Releases. This means real-time monitoring and deep context for your releases—all in one place. If you’ve ever wanted
observability and feature flags to actually work together, this is it!

[Vadim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vkorolik/) and I will be leading the observability efforts at LaunchDarkly, and
we’re excited to build towards this shared
vision. LaunchDarkly is serious about investing in observability, and together we’re going to build something that makes
the experience of debugging, monitoring, and releasing code much better!

If you’re already a LaunchDarkly customer—or thinking about becoming one—reach out. We’d love to help you get plugged
into what’s coming.

And finally, thank you. Your support and feedback have helped shape Highlight into what it is today, and we’re just
getting started. We’re incredibly grateful to have you with us for this next chapter.

The Highlight experience, as you know it, won't be changing right away, so there's nothing to worry about. Your account
will
remain active and you'll still have access to the same product, team, and energy. When we make changes in the future,
we'll be sure to let you know well in advance. To help answer some common questions, see the the FAQ below.

Can’t wait to build something amazing together, thank you once again!

## FAQ: Highlight + LaunchDarkly

**Q: What happens to my current Highlight account?**

Nothing is changing right now. Your account will remain active and you'll continue to receive the same product
experience. We are currently working on the full integration plan and will eventually migrate our Highlight
infrastructure over to LaunchDarkly, but this will happen as a slow, phased rollout, and you'll receive plenty of notice
before anything changes.

**Q: Do I need a LaunchDarkly account to keep using Highlight?**

Nope! Highlight will continue to run as a standalone product for now. You can keep using it exactly as you have been—no
separate account required.

**Q: Will my current pricing or plan change?**

No immediate changes are planned. Your current Highlight plan will stay the same, and we’ll communicate clearly about
any future updates well in advance.

**Q: What’s changing behind the scenes?**

Vadim and Jay from Highlight are now leading observability efforts at LaunchDarkly. Over time, Highlight will be
integrated into the LaunchDarkly platform—especially around Guarded Releases. Regarding our roadmap, there will be a lot
of overlap with our existing Highlight roadmap, which will include improving the existing Highlight feature set, but
also integrating them more deeply with the LaunchDarkly core feature management experience.

**Q: Will Highlight still work with my current stack?**

Yes. Everything about how Highlight works with your current tools and stack remains the same. We plan to slowly migrate
the SDKs over to LaunchDarkly SDKs, but the existing Highlight SDKs will remain untouched.

**Q: What will happen to the Highlight infrastructure and site?**

We’ll continue to run Highlight’s existing infrastructure and site alongside LaunchDarkly until the full feature set is
integrated into the LaunchDarkly platform.

**Q: When will LaunchDarkly fully integrate Highlight’s features?**

We expect full integration in approximately 6–12 months. You’ll start seeing benefits from the partnership well before
then, but we’ll keep Highlight running independently until that integration is complete.

**Q: Who do I contact for support?**

Keep reaching out to the Highlight team as usual (i.e. support@highlight.io + slack). Same people, same channels. Over
time, we will introduce new tools to leverage our new support resources.

**Q: What does this mean for the Highlight roadmap?**

Mostly it means that it will move at an accelerated pace. With more resources than before, we’re doubling down on even
more observability features—especially for releases and feature flag-level insights.

**Q: What will happen to the open source repo?**

Highlight will remain open source in its current state, open to the community for maintenance and improvement. As we
integrate with LaunchDarkly, we’ll release critical fixes back to the open source repository. 
We'll let the community know the final support date within the next few weeks, so stay tuned.

After this transition period, the Highlight team will be focusing their efforts exclusively on integration, but the repo
will still be there for community involvement and oversight!
