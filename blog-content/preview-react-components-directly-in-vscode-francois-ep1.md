## Overview

Today we interviewed Francois Wouts, the author of popular open source library Preview.js. Preview.js unlocks the ability to preview UI components in your editor, shortening the feedback loop when making UI changes. Unlike something like Storybook, Preview.js requires no setup and they also have a Storybook integration in the works :)

Hope you enjoy the interview!
