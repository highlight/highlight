metaTitle: The 5 Best Logging Libraries for Python
---

When a deployed application fails unexpectedly in production, it can be difficult to pinpoint where, when, or why the problem occurred. To remedy this, you can configure logging in to your application to keep track of activities in files or send them to a [monitoring tool](https://www.highlight.io/blog/what-is-frontend-monitoring). These logs function as an audit trail that can tell developers the state of application before the an issue arose, making it easier to debug the issue. In addition, logging also gives product teams insights into how users are using the application, which can help them make better decisions for the application's user experience.

Python ships with a logging library, and the community also offers third-party libraries that you can use for logging.

In this article, we'll explore the five best logging libraries for Python:

- [Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru)
- [Standard Library Logging Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
- [LogBook](https://github.com/getlogbook/logbook)
- [Structlog](https://github.com/hynek/structlog)
- [Picologging](https://github.com/microsoft/picologging)

## Why Use Logging Libraries for Python?

Often programmers gravitate to using the `print()` method to log and debug their applications. While this is easier to do, it has a lot of drawbacks:

- The logs are difficult to read, parse, or filter as they are not in a structured format like JSON nor have fields, such as severity level, or timestamp to add more context.
- hard to configure your application to collect all logs and send them to multiple destinations, for example, files, sockets, standard output, or emails.
- If your application is a library meant to be imported and used by other developers, the print messages can clutter the user's standard output.

Consider the following example using the `print()` statement:

```
print("This is a trace message.")
print("A debug message.")
```

```
# Output
This is a trace message.
A debug message.
```

It is harder to know the severity of the messages or when the message was generated. You could alter the `print()` statement to include the level, and timestamp but you would just be re-eventing the wheel because most logging libraries do this by default.

Now, compare the output from `print()` with the output from a Python logging library:

```
{"level": "WARNING", "message": "This is a warning message", "asctime": "2023-03-28 07:46:24,435"}
```

The following are some of the things that stand out from the log message:

- The log message is in a structured format(JSON), which is machine-readable.
- It includes a level that indicates the severance of the message. Most libraries support the following levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, and `CRITICAL`.
- It includes a timestamp(`asctime`), which tells you the date the log message was created.
- It contains the message that describes the event that occurred.

On top of that, you can customize the log messages to add more information, for instance, the process ID, the module name, the name of the logger, etc.

Another reason to consider using a logging library is that they can send the logs to multiple persistent storages, which include the standard output, files, emails, sockets, or monitoring tools.

Now that you have an idea of how handy a logging library is, we will go over the five best logging libraries in Python.

## 5 Best Python Logging Libraries

### #1 Loguru

[Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) is a popular, third-party logging library developed to make logging easier in Python. It is pre-configured with a lot of useful functionality, allowing you to do common tasks without spending a lot of time messing with configurations. You can format logs, filter, or specify destinations to send logs using only a single `add()` function. At the time, of writing, it has 14K Github stars making it the most popular third-party logging library in Python.

Let's explore some of the Loguru features:

- Built-in support for [structured logging](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru#structured-logging-as-needed).
- Supports [pretty printing](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru#pretty-logging-with-colors).
- Creating [custom levels](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru#customizable-levels).
- Ships with a [`parser()` method](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru#convenient-parser), which lets you extract information from the logs.

### How to Use Loguru

Assuming you have a virtual environment active on your local machine, enter the following command to install `loguru`:

```bash
pip install loguru
```

Next, create a `loguru_demo.py` file and add the following code to log messages using `loguru`:

```python
from loguru import logger

logger.trace("This is a trace message.")
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.success("This is a success message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

In the first line, you import the `logger` object from `loguru`, which is pre-configured to send logs to the standard output. You then call the methods corresponding to the logging levels the module supports.

The following are the supported levels ordered in increasing severity:

- TRACE(5): low-level details of the program's logic flow.
- DEBUG(10): Information that is helpful during debugging.
- INFO(20): Confirmation that the application is behaving as expected.
- SUCCESS(25): Indicates an operation was successful.
- WARNING(30): Indicates an issue that may disrupt the application in the future.
- ERROR(40): An issue that needs your immediate attention but won't terminate the program.
- CRITICAL(50): A severe issue that can terminate the program, like "running out of memory".

When you are finished adding the code, save the file, then run the program:

```bash
python loguru_demo.py
```

The output will match the following:

![Screenshot of the output Loguru produced that is pretty-printed, and include helpful information such as the timestamp, log level,  and the message](https://i.imgur.com/jxgOEyR.png)

As you can see in the output, the log messages are colorized and include the timestamp, log level, and a message without doing any configurations.

If you examine the output closely, you will notice that a log record with the level `TRACE` is missing. This is because Loguru defaults to `DEBUG` as its minimum level; therefore, all log messages with a severity below `DEBUG` are ignored. To set `TRACE` as the minimal level, use `luguru`'s `add()` method as demonstrated below:

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys        # <!- add this line

logger.remove(0)             # <- add this line
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="TRACE")   # <- add this line

logger.trace("This is a trace message.")
...
```

When you set the minimum level using the `add()` function, you must specify the destination to send the logs. To keep things simple, you send all log messages to the standard output using `sys.stdout`.

In the output, you will now see the log message with the level `TRACE` included:

![Screenshot of the programs output, which includes the log message with the level `TRACE`](https://i.imgur.com/U44T9CE.png)

Logoru also provides the ability to customize the format of the log records using the `format` option. Pass the option to the `add()` function as done in the following simplified example:

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove(0)
logger.add(sys.stderr, format="{level} : {time} : {message}: {process}")  # <-

logger.error("This is  an error message.")
```

```
# Output
# ERROR : 2023-03-28T09:27:12.674313+0200 : This is  an error message.: 25464
#  ^                  ^                            ^                     ^
# level              time                        message                process ID
```

Anything inside `{}` like `{level}` is a formatting directive, to learn more about them, visit [the documentation]https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/logger.html#record).

You don't have to use the colons `:`, you can use anything you see fit:

```python
logger.add(sys.stderr, format="{level} - {time} - {message} - {process}")
```

```
# Output
# ERROR - 2023-03-28T09:33:29.514479+0200 - This is an error message. - 25734
```

So far, the messages have not been structured. To configure Loguru to use structured logging with JSON, you add the `serialize` option to the `add()` function:

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove(0)
logger.add(sys.stderr, serialize=True) # <-

logger.error("This is  an error message.")
```

```
# output
{"text": "2023-03-28 09:36:31.458 | ERROR    | __main__:<module>:7 - This is  an error message.\n", "record": {"elapsed": {"repr": "0:00:00.023078", "seconds": 0.023078}, "exception": null, "extra": {}, "file": {"name": "loguru_demo.py", "path": "/home/<your_username/loguru_demo/loguru_demo.py"}, "function": "<module>", "level": {"icon": "‚ùå", "name": "ERROR", "no": 40}, "line": 7, "message": "This is  an error message.", "module": "loguru_demo", "name": "__main__", "process": {"id": 25826, "name": "MainProcess"}, "thread": {"id": 140082527805440, "name": "MainThread"}, "time": {"repr": "2023-03-28 09:36:31.458896+02:00", "timestamp": 1679988991.458896}}}
```

That is a lot of fields! Loguru allows you cherry pick the fields as demonstrated below:

```python
from loguru import logger
import json     # <!- add this line
import sys

# Add the following function
def serialize(record):
    subset = {
            "level": record["level"].name,
            "timestamp": record["time"].timestamp(),
            "message": record["message"]}
    return json.dumps(subset)

# Add the following function
def formatter(record):
    record["extra"]["serialized"] = serialize(record)
    return "{extra[serialized]}\n"

logger.remove(0)
logger.add(sys.stderr, format=formatter)   # <!-

logger.error("This is  an error message.")
```

```
# Output
# "level": "ERROR", "timestamp": 1679989265.887056, "message": "This is  an error message."}
```

First, you import the `json` module. Following that, you define a `serialize()` function that returns a JSON object that only contains the fields you want: `level`, `timestamp`, and `message`. From there, you define a `formatter()` function that takes care of the formatting. Finally, you set the `format` option on the `add()` method to the `formatter` function.

If you want more details about this, see [serializing log messages using a custom function](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/resources/recipes.html#serializing-log-messages-using-a-custom-function).

Until now, you have been sending all the logs to the standard output. Let's send them to a file instead:

```python
from loguru import logger

logger.remove(0)
# modify the following line
logger.add("app.log", format="{level} : {time} : {message}: {process}")

logger.error("This is  an error message.")
```

The `add()` function now takes a filename as the first argument. The file will be created automatically for you.

After running the program, check the project directory. You will find the `app.log` file created with the following contents:

```
# Output
ERROR : 2023-03-28T09:45:53.483671+0200 : This is an error message.: 26021
```

We now looked into some of the useful features in Loguru. For more details, visit the [documentation](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html).

## #2 Standard Library Logging Module

Python ships with a [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module, which contains a lot of useful features in comparison to the default logging libraries in other programming languages. It is popular among developers, well-documented, and its functionality can be extended with third-party modules. It is a bit complex to set up some tasks in comparison to Loguru, but very powerful once you get hang of it.

The following are some of the features it offers:

- Formatting log records.
- Sending logs to multiple destinations ranging from the standard output, files, emails, sockets, and HTTP.
- Sophisticated filtering.
- Defining custom levels.
- Can be extended with other modules to support structured logging, pretty-print logging

### How to Use The Python Standard Library Logging Module

As mentioned, the logging module is built-in Python, which the latest version is Python 3.11 at the time of writing. There is no need for any installation.

To use it, create a `stdlib_demo.py`, and add the following contents:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig()
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.debug("This a debug message");
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

First, you import the `logging` class, and then do some basic configurations using the `basicConfig()` of the `logging` module.

Following that, you invoke the `getLogger()` method of the `logging` module with the app name obtained from `__name__` or you can just pass any name of your choosing.

From there, you invoke all the methods corresponding to the levels to log the message. The `logging` module supports the following levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL`. It does not support the `SUCCESS` or `TRACE` level you saw earlier with Loguru.

When you run the file, your output will look like this:

```
# output
WARNING:__main__:This is a warning message
ERROR:__main__:This is an error message
CRITICAL:__main__:This is a critical message
```

The output shows the log level, the assigned module name, and the message.

The Python's logging module defaults to the `WARNING` as the minimum level going up. That is why `DEBUG` or `INFO` levels aren't shown in the output. You can modify this behavior using the `setLevel()` method of the `logging` module as follows:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig()
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)      #<-

logger.debug("This a debug message");
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

```
# Output
DEBUG:__main__:This a debug message
INFO:__main__:This is an info message
WARNING:__main__:This is a warning message
ERROR:__main__:This is an error message
CRITICAL:__main__:This is a critical message
```

Now all the messages have been logged.

The `logging` module provides you the ability to customize log records, and configure the destination to send logs with the use of the following objects:

- [Handler Objects](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#useful-handlers): Used to send logs to various destinations, such as the file, standard output, network socket, or email to mention a few. In this post, you will use the [StreamHandler](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#streamhandler) to send logs to the standard output stream(`sys.stdout`), and the [FileHandler](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.FileHandler) to send logs to files on a computer disk.
- [Formatter objects](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#formatters): Used to change the contents or format a log message. You will use the object to add a time stamp and a process ID to the log message.

First, let's familiarize ourselves with the handler objects. We will use the `StreamHandler()` to send logs to the standard output with this latest example:

```python
import sys
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# call the `StreamHandler`
stdout_handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
# add it to the logger instance
logger.addHandler(stdout_handler)


logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

You call `StreamHandler()` with the `stream` option set to `sys.stdout` to send logs to the standard output. From there, you register it to the logger instance using the `addHandler()` method of the `logger` instance.

When run, the output will look closely to this:

```
#  Output
This is an error message
This is a critical message
```

The messages no longer have the level or name, because we no longer have the `logging.basicConfig()` to do some basic configurations, which includes formatting.

Now that you are familiar with how to use a Handler object, let's build upon the example to format the log records. As mentioned earlier, you will use the `formatter` object.

Take the following example:

```python
import sys
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

stdout_handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
format_output = logging.Formatter('%(levelname)s : %(name)s : %(message)s : %(asctime)s') # <-

# Register the formatter to the stdout handler
stdout_handler.setFormatter(format_output)      # <-
logger.addHandler(stdout_handler)

logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

The `Formatter()` function takes a string that defines the message format using the [logrecord attributes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes).

Running the file will yield the following output:

```
# Output
# ERROR : __main__ : This is an error message : 2023-03-28 13:46:11,510
# CRITICAL : __main__ : This is a critical message : 2023-03-28 13:46:11,510
#
#  ^           ^                ^                             ^
# levelname   name           message                      asctime
```

Now let's make the logs structured using the JSON format. The logging module currently doesn't have built-in support for creating structured logs. Thanks to the community, you can use the [python-json-logger](https://github.com/madzak/python-json-logger) module to create the structured logs.

First, install the module as follows:

```bash
pip install python-json-logger
```

And modify the example as follows:

```python
import sys
import logging
from pythonjsonlogger import jsonlogger   #<-  add this

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
stdout_handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)

# format with JSON
format_output = jsonlogger.JsonFormatter('%(levelname)s : %(name)s : %(message)s : %(asctime)s') # <-

stdout_handler.setFormatter(format_output)
logger.addHandler(stdout_handler)

logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

First, you import the `jsonlogger` from the `python-json-logger` module. Next, you invoke the `JsonFormatter()` method of the `jsonlogger` with the string containing logrecord attributes we want to see in the JSON log message.

You will receive the following output when you run the file:

```
# Output
{"levelname": "ERROR", "name": "__main__", "message": "This is an error message", "asctime": "2023-03-28 14:04:01,930"}
{"levelname": "CRITICAL", "name": "__main__", "message": "This is a critical message", "asctime": "2023-03-28 14:04:01,930"}
```

Now, the example currently sends the structured log records to the standard output. Let's modify to forward logs in a file as well:

```python
import sys
import logging
from pythonjsonlogger import jsonlogger

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

stdout_handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
## Create a file handler
fileHandler = logging.FileHandler("app.log")   # <-

format_output = jsonlogger.JsonFormatter('%(levelname)s : %(name)s : %(message)s : %(asctime)s')

stdout_handler.setFormatter(format_output)

fileHandler.setFormatter(format_output)     # <-

logger.addHandler(stdout_handler)
## the file handle handler
logger.addHandler(fileHandler)             # <-

logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

After running the file, you will find the `app.log` file created in the directory with the following contents:

```
# Output
{"levelname": "ERROR", "name": "__main__", "message": "This is an error message", "asctime": "2023-03-28 15:57:33,362"}
{"levelname": "CRITICAL", "name": "__main__", "message": "This is a critical message", "asctime": "2023-03-28 15:57:33,362"}
```

We have barely scratched the surface of what the `logging` module is capable of doing. If you want to learn more, visit the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).

## #3 LogBook

Another logging library to consider is the [LogBook](http://logbook.readthedocs.org/) module, which at the time of writing has about 1.4K stars on GitHub. The developers built it as a replacement for the standard library's logging module.

It has a lot of helpful features:

- Sending log messages on several mediums, such as phone or desktop notification systems using the [notifiers](https://logbook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/notifiers.html#notifiers) module.
- ships with handlers that can forward logs to streams, files, or emails.
- Supports Redis, ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ, and many more.

To explore more features, visit [LogBook documentation](https://logbook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features.html#core-features)

### How to Use LogBook

First, install the library in the project directory:

```bash
pip install logbook
```

Create a `logbook_demo.py` file, then add the following:

```python
from logbook import Logger, StreamHandler
import sys

logger = Logger(__name__)
StreamHandler(sys.stdout).push_application()

logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.notice("This is a notice message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

In the first line, you import the `Logger`, and the `StreamHandler`. Next, you create an instance of the logger. Following that, you use the `StreamHandler()` method to send logs to the standard output stream.

Running the file produces the following output:

```
# Output
[2023-03-28 15:28:39.915738] DEBUG: __main__: This is a debug message.
[2023-03-28 15:28:39.915948] INFO: __main__: This is an info message.
[2023-03-28 15:28:39.916053] NOTICE: __main__: This is a notice message.
[2023-03-28 15:28:39.916152] WARNING: __main__: This is a warning message.
[2023-03-28 15:28:39.916258] ERROR: __main__: This is  an error message.
[2023-03-28 15:28:39.916403] CRITICAL: __main__: This is a critical message.
```

Take note in the output that the library supports all the levels that the standard library's logging module supports. It only adds one level `NOTICE`, useful for creating non-error messages.

If you want to get send logs to a file, you can use the `FileHandler()`. Take a look at the following example:

```python
import logbook
import sys

logger = logbook.Logger(__name__)

log = logbook.FileHandler('app.log', level='INFO') # <-
log.push_application()

logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

The `FileHandler()` method takes the name of the log file, and the minimum supported level, which is `INFO` here.

Running the file creates an `app.log` file containing the following contents:

```
# Output
[2023-03-28 15:34:35.811250] ERROR: __main__: This is  an error message.
[2023-03-28 15:34:35.811626] CRITICAL: __main__: This is a critical message.
```

Logbook also provides a `format_string` property that you can use to change the format of the log messages. Consider the following example:

```python
import logbook
import sys

logger = logbook.Logger(__name__)

log = logbook.FileHandler('app.log', level='INFO')
log.format_string = '{record.level_name} : {record.message} : {record.time} '   # <-
log.push_application()

logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

You set the `format_string` to a string, which uses the logrecord attributes `time`, `level_name`, and `message` of the `record` object.

When you run the file, the output will match the following:

```
# Output
ERROR : This is an error message. : 2023-03-28 15:41:08.677903
CRITICAL : This is a critical message. : 2023-03-28 15:41:08.678186
```

The log message now starts with the level instead of the timestamp.

Setting up structured logging is challenging with LogBook, the maintainers recommend implementing a handler to do it. For more details, visit Logbook's [Github Issues page](https://github.com/getlogbook/logbook/issues/279).

Now that you have the basic knowledge of how to use LogBook, visit the [documentation page](https://logbook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html) to learn more about other features.

## #4 Structlog

[Structlog](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/bound-loggers.html) is a small structured logging library in Python. It was developed in 2013 and is constantly keeping up with changes in Python, such as context variables, asyncio, and type hints. It currently has over 2.5K stars on GitHub at the time of the writing.

The following are some of the main features:

- Built-in structured logging
- Supports [filtering](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/bound-loggers.html#filtering) logs
- pretty printing [with colors](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/console-output.html)
- Can be configured to work with the standard logging library.
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous methods.

### How to Use Structlog

Install the `structlog` module as follows:

```bash
pip install structlog
```

Create a `structlog_demo.py` file, then add the following contents to initialize the logger:

```python
import structlog
logger = structlog.getLogger(__name__)

logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

![Screenshot of the output showing 5 log messages in color, starting from the `DEBUG` all the way down to `CRITICAL`](https://i.imgur.com/wqYoG7X.png)

`structlog` colorizes the output to make it easier to distinguish the messages. It supports all the five levels the standard library's logging module supports, which include `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL`.

If you want the logs to be structured, you can configure `structlog` with a chain of processors as follows:

```python
import logging
import structlog

structlog.configure(
        processors =  [
            structlog.processors.TimeStamper(),
            structlog.processors.add_log_level,
            structlog.processors.JSONRenderer(),
            ]
        )
logger = structlog.get_logger()
logger.error("This is an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

The processors modify the log messages and pass the value to the next processor. The first `TimeStamper()` processor adds a time stamp, then the message is passed to the `add_log_level` processor to add a severity level. Finally, the log message is passed to the `JSONRenderer()` processor to log the message in JSON format.

Upon running the file, the output will look similar to the following:

```
# Output
{"event": "This is an error message.", "timestamp": 1680019746.526201, "level": "error"}
{"event": "This is a critical message.", "timestamp": 1680019746.5263886, "level": "critical"}
```

There is so much to the `structlog` library, visit the [documentation](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable) page to discover more features.

## #5 Picologging

[Picologging](https://microsoft.github.io/picologging/) is a recently-made logging module, which is 9 months old and has over 500 stars on GitHub at the time of writing. Microsoft developed it to replace the standard library's logging module and claims it is 4-10x faster than the built-in solution. However, the documentation states that it is in the early-alpha stage and has some missing features. But still, it is a promising solution and something to keep an eye on.

Picologging has the following features:

- uses the same API as the built-in logging module.
- Formatting messages
- Forwarding logs to persisting storages, for instance, the standard output, files, emails, sockets, or more using [handlers](https://microsoft.github.io/picologging/handlers.html#)

Put simply, all the features provided by the built-in logging library are supported by the Picologging library with a caveat that some features are missing because it is still in the alpha stage.

### How to Use Picologging

Install the module in a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install picologging
```

Create a `pico_demo.py` file with the following contents:

```python
import picologging

pic
logger = picologging.Logger(__name__, picologging.DEBUG)

logger.debug("This a debug message");
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

```
# Output
This a debug message
This is an info message
This is a warning message
This is an error message
This is a critical message
```

As you can see, the code looks similar to the first example when we covered the standard library's logging library. Formatting messages can also be done the same as you did earlier using the standard library's logging module:

```python
import sys
import picologging

logger = picologging.getLogger("example__app")

stdout_handler = picologging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
format_output = picologging.Formatter('%(levelname)s : %(name)s : %(message)s : %(asctime)s')

stdout_handler.setFormatter(format_output)
logger.addHandler(stdout_handler)

logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

If you compare the example with the one using the built-in logging module, you will only notice a few differences. `logging` has been substituted with `picologging`, and `StreamHandler()` no longer has the `stream` attribute.

If you want to explore this library, refer to the section covering the standard library's logging module to experiment with logging into files, and structured logging. Be sure to check out the [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/picologging/), as well as the standard library's logging module [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).

## Conclusion

In this article, we looked at the best 5 logging libraries available for Python. If you are still undecided, we recommend starting with the [`loguru`](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) library as it is easy to get started. Later when you have the time, it is still worth learning the standard library's logging module as it is popular and most logging library APIs are inspired or built upon it. With the advent of [`Picologging`](https://microsoft.github.io/picologging/), which looks promising in terms of performance, familiarity with the built-in module will help you make a smooth transition if it gets traction.
