## AI for your React Component Library

Alex Danilowicz is the co-founder of Magic Patterns, a generative AI tool for building front-end web applications.

Alex and his co-founder [Teddy Ni](https://twitter.com/teddarific), best friends since college, started Magic Patterns after years of experience as front-end engineers. MagicPatterns is a generative AI tool that acts as your front-end design assistant.

MagicPatterns expands upon CoPilot, ChatGPT and other LLMs by integrating tightly with your existing component library to generate components that can drop straight into your codebase. MagicPatterns can import from Figma and also push designs **into Figma**.

## The future of AI-powered development:

Magic Patterns is a design tool as well as a coding tool. Alex envisions integrating the platform further into developers' workflows, like through VS Code extensions or Figma plugins.
