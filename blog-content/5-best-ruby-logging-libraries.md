metaTitle: The 5 Best Logging Libraries for Ruby
---

Logging allows you to record important activities on your application to persisting storages, such as files, emails, or a [monitoring tool](https://www.highlight.io/blog/what-is-frontend-monitoring). This creates an audit trail that documents the state of your application before something goes wrong. The logs can help developers during debugging or even product teams to learn how users are using the application to create better experiences.

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) has a built-in logging library, as well as a plethora of third-party logging libraries to choose from.

In this article, we'll explore the five best logging libraries for Ruby:

- [Semantic Logger](https://logger.rocketjob.io/)
- [Logger class](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html)
- [logging](https://github.com/twp/logging)
- [Ougai](https://github.com/tilfin/ougai)
- [Yell](https://github.com/rudionrails/yell)

## Why Use Logging Libraries for Ruby?

If by any chance, you consider using the `puts()` method for logging in to your application, they are a couple of issues you need aware of:

- The messages can be difficult to read for both humans and machines because of the lack of severity levels, timestamps, or a machine-readable format like JSON.
- Difficult to create functionality to collect all log messages to destinations such as files, emails, sockets, or monitoring tools.
- If the application is a module that can be used by other developers, it can clutter the standard output.

Take a look at the following example using `puts()`:

```ruby
puts("This is a trace message.")
puts("A debug message.")
```

```
# Output
This is a trace message.
A debug message.
```

If you look at the output, you will see that nothing is differentiating these messages. There are no severity levels, timestamps, or process IDs to add more context to the message.

Now, let's compare the output with the one from a logging library:

```
{"timestamp":"2023-03-29T07:19:25.019784Z","level":"error","pid":9879, "file":"program_name.rb","line":10,"name":"MyApp","message":"This is  an error message."}
```

There are a lot of interesting things with this message:

- It is structured in JSON format, which is machine-readable.
- It has a timestamp that tells the date the log entry was made.
- has a severity level, which indicates the message's significance. The most common levels are `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, and `FATAL`.

Creating a structured logging message is easy with most logging tools as the functionality is built-in. You can also customize the log messages to include or remove other unwanted fields.

Most logging tools also make it easier to send log messages to multiple destinations, such as files, standard output, sockets, monitoring tools, etc.

Now that you know why a logging library is essential, we will go over the five best logging libraries in Ruby.

## 5 Best Ruby Logging Libraries

## #1 Semantic logger

[Semantic Logger](https://logger.rocketjob.io/) is a popular feature-rich logging library for Ruby. It claims it can log thousands of lines without affecting the application performance by pushing the log events in an in-memory queue that resides in a separate thread. The thread is dedicated to sending logs to multiple persisting storages.

The following is a summary of the Semantic Logger features:

- Supports structured logging with JSON.
- Sending logs to multiple destinations, such as the standard output, file, MongoDB, HTTP, and other logging libraries.
- formatting log messages.
- faster performance.
- pretty printing with color.

### How to Use Semantic logger

Install the package with the following command:

```bash
 gem install semantic_logger
```

Next, create a `semantic_demo.rb` file and add the following contents to create the logger instance:

```ruby
require "semantic_logger"

SemanticLogger.add_appender(io:STDOUT)

logger = SemanticLogger["MyApp"]

logger.trace("This is a trace message")
logger.debug("This a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

In the first line, you import the `semantic_logger` module. Next, you use the `add_appender()` method to specify the destination to send logs, which is the standard output here(`STDOUT`).

Following that, you create a logger instance with a name of your choosing. Finally, you call all the methods that correspond to the levels the module supports.

The module supports the following levels ordered with increasing severity:

- TRACE: low-level information that details the program's logic flow.
- DEBUG: Information developers may need during debugging.
- INFO: Confirmation that the application is working well.
- WARN: An issue that may interrupt the application in the future.
- ERROR: information that needs your immediate attention but won't cause the program to exit.
- FATAL: Something serious that can terminate the program.

Once you are done making the changes, save and run the file:

```bash
ruby semantic_demo.rb
```

You will receive output that looks close to this:

```
# Output
2023-03-28 20:46:39.969328 I [19340:60] MyApp -- This is an info message.
2023-03-28 20:46:39.969451 W [19340:60] MyApp -- This is a warning message.
2023-03-28 20:46:39.969494 E [19340:60 semantic_demo.rb:11] MyApp -- This is  an error message.
2023-03-28 20:46:39.972206 F [19340:60 semantic_demo.rb:12] MyApp -- This is a fatal message.
#   ^                      ^      ^             ^            ^               ^
#  timestamp              level  process ID   filename     logger name       message
```

In the output, the message is logged along with the timestamp, level, process ID, filename, and the logger name you passed when you created an instance of the logger. Note that the level is denoted with a single letter(`I` for `INFO`, `W` for `WARN`, etc)

If you examine the output, you will see `TRACE`(`T`) and `DEBUG`(`D`) are missing. This is because Semantic Logger is set to `INFO` as the minimum level. So all the levels less severe than `INFO` are ignored. To override the default behavior, use the `default_level` property as follows:

```ruby
require "semantic_logger"

SemanticLogger.default_level = :trace      #<-
SemanticLogger.add_appender(io:STDOUT)

logger = SemanticLogger["MyApp"]

logger.trace("This is a trace message")
logger.debug("This a debug message.")
...
```

```
# Output
2023-03-28 21:17:36.236806 T [20478:60] MyApp -- This is a trace message
2023-03-28 21:17:36.236885 D [20478:60] MyApp -- This a debug message.
2023-03-28 21:17:36.236904 I [20478:60] MyApp -- This is an info message.
2023-03-28 21:17:36.236914 W [20478:60] MyApp -- This is a warning message.
2023-03-28 21:17:36.236924 E [20478:60 semantic_demo.rb:12] MyApp -- This is  an error message.
2023-03-28 21:17:36.239308 F [20478:60 semantic_demo.rb:13] MyApp -- This is a fatal message.
```

The output now shows all the levels. If you want to colorize the output to easily discern the messages, you can add a `formatter` option to the `add_appender()` method. Take a look at the following simplified example:

```ruby
require "semantic_logger"

SemanticLogger.default_level = :trace
# add color support
SemanticLogger.add_appender(io:STDOUT, formatter: :color)   # <-

logger = SemanticLogger["MyApp"]

logger.trace("This is a trace message")
logger.debug("This a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warnig message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

![Screenshot of the log records colorized](https://i.imgur.com/dUJQrXZ.png)

Semantic Logger is configurable, and if you want to save the logs to a file, you use the `file_name` property. Consider the following simplified example:

```ruby
require "semantic_logger"

SemanticLogger.add_appender(file_name: "app.log")    # <-

logger = SemanticLogger["MyApp"]

logger.warn("This is a trace message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
```

The `add_appender()` method of the `SemanticLogger` now accepts a `file_name` property, which is set to the file name you want your logs to be written.

After running the file, the `app.log` file will be created. When you open the file, you will find content that looks similar to the following:

```
# Output
2023-03-29 08:46:10.115856 W [8289:60] MyApp -- This is a trace message.
2023-03-29 08:46:10.115985 E [8289:60 semantic_demo.rb:8] MyApp -- This is  an error message.
```

You can also customize the log messages using a `formatter` property that you can pass the `add_appender()` method as demonstrated in the following example:

```ruby
require "semantic_logger"

formatter = Proc.new do |log|
  "#{log.level}: #{log.time} : #{log.message}"
end

SemanticLogger.add_appender(io:STDOUT, formatter: formatter)

logger = SemanticLogger["MyApp"]


logger.warn("This is a trace message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
```

You create a `formatter` proc object that formats each log message with the attributes of the [Log Event](https://logger.rocketjob.io/log_struct.html) object:

- `level`: the severity of the message.
- `time`: the time that the log entry was created.
- `message`: the message that needs to be logged.

Following this, you set the `formatter` property in the `add_appender()` method to the `formatter` proc object.

Upon running the file, you will receive output similar to the following:

```
# Output
warn: 2023-03-29 09:11:04 +0200 : This is a trace message.
error: 2023-03-29 09:11:04 +0200 : This is  an error message.
#
# ^          ^                           ^
log.level   log.time                  log.message
```

Until now, the log records have not been structured, which can be difficult to parse or filter. Let's make them structured using the JSON format. To do that, let's look at a new example that formats log records using the JSON format and sends them to the standard output:

```ruby
require "semantic_logger"


SemanticLogger.add_appender(io:STDOUT, formatter: :json)

logger = SemanticLogger["MyApp"]


logger.warn("This is a trace message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
```

In the `add_appender()` method, you set the `formatter` property to `:json` to use the JSON format. When you run the file, the output matches the following:

```
# Output
{"host":"your_hostname","application":"Semantic Logger","timestamp":"2023-03-29T07:19:25.019639Z","level":"warn","level_index":3,"pid":9879,"thread":"60","name":"MyApp","message":"This is a trace message."}
{"host":"your_hostname","application":"Semantic Logger","timestamp":"2023-03-29T07:19:25.019784Z","level":"error","level_index":4,"pid":9879,"thread":"60","file":"semantic_demo.rb","line":10,"name":"MyApp","message":"This is  an error message."}
```

The log messages are now structured and machines can easily parse them.

Now that you have an idea of how to use the Semantic Logger, you can continue learning about it in the [documentation](https://logger.rocketjob.io/).

### #2 Logger Class

The Ruby standard library ships with a sophisticated [Logging library](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) that contains a lot of useful features that can make logging easier. It has good documentation and a simple API in comparison to loggers in other programming languages.

The following are some of the features available in the Logger class:

- built-in support for rolling log files automatically.
- Can send logs to multiple destinations
- supports structured logging
- formatting log messages

### How to Use the Logger Class

The `Logger` class comes with the Ruby standard library, so there is no need to install anything.

To use it, create a `logger_demo.rb` file with the following code:

```ruby
require 'logger'

logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)

logger.debug("A debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
logger.unknown("This is an unknown message.")
```

In the first line, you import the `Logger` class. After that, you invoke the `Logger`'s class `new()` method that accepts a log device, which can be a file name or IO object like `STDOUT`, or `STDERROR`.

The `Logger` supports all the levels supported in the Semantic Logger module, and it adds one more level `UNKWOWN`, for logging unknown messages.

When you run the file `ruby logger_demo.rb`, it will yield the following output:

```
# Output
D, [2023-03-29T10:25:31.732624 #12369] DEBUG -- : A debug message.
I, [2023-03-29T10:25:31.732737 #12369]  INFO -- : This is an info message.
W, [2023-03-29T10:25:31.732790 #12369]  WARN -- : This is a warning message.
E, [2023-03-29T10:25:31.732837 #12369] ERROR -- : This is  an error message.
F, [2023-03-29T10:25:31.732880 #12369] FATAL -- : This is a fatal message.
A, [2023-03-29T10:25:31.732922 #12369]   ANY -- : This is an unknown message.
```

By default, the minimum log level is set to `DEBUG`. You can modify this anytime. In the following code block, set the minimum log level to `WARN`:

```ruby
require 'logger'

logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
logger.level = Logger::WARN    # <-

logger.debug("A debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
logger.unknown("This is an unknown message.")
```

```
# Output
W, [2023-03-29T10:30:29.186132 #12515]  WARN -- : This is a warning message.
E, [2023-03-29T10:30:29.186237 #12515] ERROR -- : This is  an error message.
F, [2023-03-29T10:30:29.186275 #12515] FATAL -- : This is a fatal message.
A, [2023-03-29T10:30:29.186309 #12515]   ANY -- : This is an unknown message.
```

Now, only levels with the severity of `WARN` or higher are logged. `DEBUG`, and `INFO` levels are discarded.

To send the logs in a file, modify the `Logger.new()` method to take the file name:

```ruby
require 'logger'

logger = Logger.new('app.log')  # <!-
logger.level = Logger::WARN

logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
```

In the directory, you will find the `app.log` file with the following log messages once you open it:

```
# Output
# Logfile created on 2023-03-29 10:34:45 +0200 by logger.rb/v1.5.3
W, [2023-03-29T10:34:45.834250 #12648]  WARN -- : This is a warning message.
E, [2023-03-29T10:34:45.834478 #12648] ERROR -- : This is  an error message.
```

If the log message format doesn't work for you, you can customize it using a `formatter` property set to a proc object. Take a look at the following example:

```ruby
require 'logger'

logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)      # <- send logs STDOUT
logger.level = Logger::WARN
# forma the log message
logger.formatter = proc do |severity, datetime, progname, msg|  # <-
  "#{severity} : #{datetime}: #{msg} : #{Process.pid}\n"
end

logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
```

`formatter` is set to a proc object with the parameters `severity`, `datetime`, `prog_name`, and `msg`. You use these constants to format the log message string and also include a process ID.

Running the file yields the following output:

```
# Output
 WARN : 2023-03-29 10:45:34 +0200: This is a warning message. : 13167
 ERROR : 2023-03-29 10:45:34 +0200: This is  an error message. : 13167
# ^                 ^                       ^                      ^
# severity       datetime                  msg                   Process.pid
```

Let's make the logs structured to make them machine-parseable. Modify the example as follows:

```ruby
require 'logger'
require "json"   # <-

logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
logger.level = Logger::WARN

logger.formatter = proc do |severity, datetime, progname, msg|
  # modify the following line
  JSON.dump(level: "#{severity}", date: "#{datetime}", msg: "#{msg}", pid: "#{Process.pid}") + "\n"
end

logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
```

You import the `json` module first. Next, you modify the `formatter` proc to a proc to return JSON.

With that, you can use the Logger class for structured logging. For more details about the Logger class, refer to the [documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html).

## #3 Logging

Third on our list is the [logging](https://github.com/twp/logging) module, also capable of creating parseable logs. The design of the module was heavily inspired by Java's log4j library. As of this writing, it currently has over 500 stars on GitHub.

The following are some of the interesting features it offers:

- Structured logging
- Formatting log messages
- Sending logs to multiple destinations
- Creating custom logs

### How to Use Logging

To use it, install the module as follows:

```bash
gem install logging
```

Create a `logging_demo.rb` file with the following code:

```ruby
require 'logging'

logger = Logging.logger['example_logger']
logger.add_appenders(Logging.appenders.stdout)

logger.debug("This a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

First, you import the `logging` module. Second, you create the logger instance. Following this, you invoke `add_appenders()` with the destination you want to send the logs to, which is the standard output here. Finally, you invoke all the methods corresponding to the supported levels.

The module supports all the five logging levels that the Semantic Logger module supports: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL`.

When you run the file, the output will resemble the following:

```
# Output
DEBUG  example_logger : This a debug message.
 INFO  example_logger : This is an info message.
 WARN  example_logger : This is a warning message.
ERROR  example_logger : This is  an error message.
FATAL  example_logger : This is a fatal message.
```

By default, the minimum level is set to `DEBUG`. You can specify a different level in the `add_appenders()` method as follows:

```ruby
require 'logging'

logger = Logging.logger['example_logger']
logger.add_appenders(Logging.appenders.stdout(:level => :warn))  #<-

logger.debug("This a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

In the `appenders.stdout()` function, you set the minimum level to `WARN`. To verify this, run the file to see output that looks similar to this:

```
# Output
 WARN  example_logger : This is a warning message.
ERROR  example_logger : This is  an error message.
FATAL  example_logger : This is a fatal message.
```

You can configure the `logging` module to send logs to multiple destinations, such as the standard output, as well as a file. The previous example already sends logs to standard output. So let's add another appender to send logs to a file:

```ruby
require 'logging'

logger = Logging.logger['example_logger']
logger.add_appenders(
  Logging.appenders.stdout(:level => :warn),
  Logging.appenders.file('app.log')) #  <-

logger.debug("This a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

The `add_appenders()` method now takes a `file()` method call that accepts the file name as an argument.

Running the file will create an `app.log` file in the project directory. When you open the file, you will see log messages like this:

```
# Output
DEBUG  example_logger : This a debug message.
 INFO  example_logger : This is an info message.
 WARN  example_logger : This is a warning message.
ERROR  example_logger : This is  an error message.
FATAL  example_logger : This is a fatal message
```

When you look at the output, you will see that all the log calls have been logged. You can change the minimum level the same way you did in the `stdout()` function. You also have the option of setting the minimum level globally like so:

```ruby
require 'logging'

logger = Logging.logger['example_logger']
logger.level = :warn    # <-
logger.add_appenders(
  Logging.appenders.stdout,    # <- remove the level
  Logging.appenders.file('app.log'))

logger.debug("This a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

To test the changes, delete the `app.log` file, then run the file again to see the following:

```
# Output
 WARN  example_logger : This is a warning message.
ERROR  example_logger : This is  an error message.
FATAL  example_logger : This is a fatal message.
```

If you want to use structured logging with the JSON format, take a look at the following example:

```ruby
require 'logging'

logger = Logging.logger['example_logger']
logger.level = :warn

logger.add_appenders(Logging.appenders.file(
  'logs.json',
  :layout => Logging.layouts.json))

logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

In the `add_appenders()` method, you pass the `file()` method to send logs to a `logs.json` file. You also pass `:layout`, which is set to `layouts.json` to format the logs using JSON.

Upon running the file, the `layouts.json` will be created containing log messages in JSON format:

```
# Output
{"timestamp":"2023-03-29T14:10:58.980863+02:00","level":"ERROR","logger":"example_logger","message":"This is  an error message."}
```

To continue exploring the `logging` library features, see the [documentation](https://github.com/twp/logging).

## #4 Ougai

[Ougai](https://github.com/tilfin/ougai) is a structured logging library that builds upon the standard [Logger class](https://github.com/tilfin/ougai) module in Ruby. At the time of writing, it has 240 Github stars and boost of having the following features:

- Structuring logs out of the box.
- forwarding logs to multiple destinations.
- can produce human-readable-logs in the console with the [Amazing Print](https://github.com/amazing-print/amazing_print) module.

### How to Use Ougai

Install the Ougai module:

```bash
gem install ougai
```

Create a `ougai_demo.rb` and add the code below:

```ruby
require 'ougai'

logger = Ougai::Logger.new($stdout)

logger.trace("This a trace message.")
logger.debug("This a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

In the preceding code, you create a logger instance with `$stdout` to send the logs to the standard output. You then call all the log methods that corresponds to the levels. It supports the same levels as the Semantic Logger module, which were defined in the section covering Semantic Logger.

When you run the file, the output will match the following:

```
# Output
{"name":"ougai_demo","hostname":"<your_hostname>","pid":28238,"level":20,"time":"2023-03-29T16:33:56.827+02:00","v":0,"msg":"This a debug message."}
{"name":"ougai_demo","hostname":"<your_hostname>","pid":28238,"level":30,"time":"2023-03-29T16:33:56.827+02:00","v":0,"msg":"This is an info message."}
{"name":"ougai_demo","hostname":"<your_hostname>","pid":28238,"level":40,"time":"2023-03-29T16:33:56.827+02:00","v":0,"msg":"This is a warning message."}
{"name":"ougai_demo","hostname":"<your_hostname>","pid":28238,"level":50,"time":"2023-03-29T16:33:56.827+02:00","v":0,"msg":"This is  an error message."}
{"name":"ougai_demo","hostname":"<your_hostname>","pid":28238,"level":60,"time":"2023-03-29T16:33:56.827+02:00","v":0,"msg":"This is a fatal message."}
```

In the output, all the log messages are in JSON format. The `level` property is set to a numeric value. If you are unfamiliarr with the numeric values, look at the following:

- `TRACE`: 10
- `DEBUG`: 20
- `INFO`: 30
- `WARN`: 40
- `ERROR`: 50
- `FATAL`: 60

If you closely look at the beginning of the output, you will see that a log message with level that has a numeric value `10`(`TRACE`) has been omitted. By default, the minimum level is set to `DEBUG`. To see the message, look at the following example:

```ruby
require 'ougai'

logger = Ougai::Logger.new($stdout)
logger.level = Ougai::Logger::TRACE     # <-

logger.trace("This a trace message.")
logger.debug("This a debug message.")
```

```
# output
{"name":"ougai_demo","hostname":"<your_hostname>","pid":30142,"level":10,"time":"2023-03-29T17:37:05.522+02:00","v":0,"msg":"This a trace message."}
{"name":"ougai_demo","hostname":"<your_hostname>","pid":30142,"level":20,"time":"2023-03-29T17:37:05.522+02:00","v":0,"msg":"This a debug message."}
```

Now, the log message with the level set to the numeric value `10` appears in the output.

To redirect the output to a file, pass a filename to the `Logger.new()` method:

```ruby
require 'ougai'

logger = Ougai::Logger.new('./app.log')   # <-
logger.level = Ougai::Logger::TRACE

logger.trace("This a trace message.")
logger.debug("This a debug message.")
```

Running the code creates an `app.log` file in the directory that the following log messages:

```
# Output
# Logfile created on 2023-03-29 17:41:57 +0200 by logger.rb/v1.5.3
{"name":"ougai_demo","hostname":"ulilic","pid":30357,"level":10,"time":"2023-03-29T17:41:57.615+02:00","v":0,"msg":"This a trace message."}
{"name":"ougai_demo","hostname":"ulilic","pid":30357,"level":20,"time":"2023-03-29T17:41:57.615+02:00","v":0,"msg":"This a debug message."}
```

If you want to add a custom field to all logging methods, you can use the `with_fields` property as follows:

```ruby
require 'ougai'

logger = Ougai::Logger.new($stdout)    # <- send logs to stdout
logger.level = Ougai::Logger::TRACE

# add a extra field
logger.with_fields = { version: '0.01' }      # <-
logger.trace("This a trace message.")
logger.debug("This a debug message.")
```

Here, you set the `with_fields` to add the `version` field to all the log messages.

After you run the file, you will see that the `version` field has been added at the end of each log message:

```
# Output
{"name":"ougai_demo","hostname":"ulilic","pid":30730,"level":10,"time":"2023-03-29T17:47:29.424+02:00","v":0,"msg":"This a trace message.","version":"0.01"}
{"name":"ougai_demo","hostname":"ulilic","pid":30730,"level":20,"time":"2023-03-29T17:47:29.424+02:00","v":0,"msg":"This a debug message.","version":"0.01"}
```

## #5 Yell

Last on our list is [Yell](https://github.com/rudionrails/yell), which is a comprehensive logging library developed as a drop-in replacement of the built-in logging module. At the time of writing, it has 300 stars on GitHub.

The following are some of the features to consider:

- Writing logs to multiple destinations
- Formatting log messages

### How to Use Yell

Install the `yell` module:

```bash
gem install yell
```

Next, create a `yell_demo.rb` file and enter the following:

```ruby
require 'yell'

logger = Yell.new STDOUT

logger.debug("This a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

You create a logger instance with an [adapter](https://github.com/rudionrails/yell/wiki/101-using-adapters) `STDOUT` as an argument to forward log messages to the standard output. The module also supports all the levels that the standard `Logger` class supports.

When you run the file, you will get output that looks like the following:

```
2023-03-29T18:24:17+02:00 [DEBUG] 32842 : This a debug message.
2023-03-29T18:24:17+02:00 [ INFO] 32842 : This is an info message.
2023-03-29T18:24:17+02:00 [ WARN] 32842 : This is a warning message.
2023-03-29T18:24:17+02:00 [ERROR] 32842 : This is  an error message.
2023-03-29T18:24:17+02:00 [FATAL] 32842 : This is a fatal message.
```

If you want to add a minimum level, consider the following example:

```ruby
require 'yell'

logger = Yell.new STDOUT

# add a level
logger.level = 'gte.warn'     # <-

logger.debug("This a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

```
#output
2023-03-29T18:28:51+02:00 [ WARN] 33070 : This is a warning message.
2023-03-29T18:28:51+02:00 [ERROR] 33070 : This is  an error message.
2023-03-29T18:28:51+02:00 [FATAL] 33070 : This is a fatal message.
```

To send all the logs to a file, you need to pass a filename to the `new()` method in place of the `STDOUT`:

```ruby
require 'yell'

logger = Yell.new 'app.log'    # <-

logger.level = 'gte.warn'

logger.debug("This a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warn message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

Running the file creates the `app.log` file, which contains the following:

```
# Output
2023-03-29T18:34:10+02:00 [ WARN] 33399 : This is a warn message.
2023-03-29T18:34:10+02:00 [ERROR] 33399 : This is  an error message.
2023-03-29T18:34:10+02:00 [FATAL] 33399 : This is a fatal message.
```

You can also customize the log messages using `yell`. To do that, you need to pass `:format` as a second argument to the `new` method as follows:

```ruby
require 'yell'

logger = Yell.new STDOUT, :format => "%L: %m : %d"     #<-

logger.debug("This a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warn("This is a warn message.")
logger.error("This is  an error message.")
logger.fatal("This is a fatal message.")
```

```
DEBUG: This a debug message. : 2023-03-29T18:36:30+02:00
INFO: This is an info message. : 2023-03-29T18:36:30+02:00
WARN: This is a warn message. : 2023-03-29T18:36:30+02:00
ERROR: This is  an error message. : 2023-03-29T18:36:30+02:00
FATAL: This is a fatal message. : 2023-03-29T18:36:30+02:00
# ^                ^                     ^
# %L              %m                     %d
```
