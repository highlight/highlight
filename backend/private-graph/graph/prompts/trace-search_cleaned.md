Trace search allows you to filter on spans of traces in your product based on a query, and allows you to see more information on
an overarching trace by clicking into a span. You can filter spans using a search query
For example, you can get to all spans of traces produced in the last 15 minutes from a `private-graph` service by selecting "Last
15 minutes" from the time picker and entering the following query:

```
service_name=private-graph
```

## Default Key

The default key for trace search is `span_name`. If you enter an expression without a key (`gorm.Query`) it will be used as the
key for the expression (`span_name=*gorm.Query*`).

## Searchable Attributes

You can search on any attributes that you send in your traces as well as any of the default attributes assigned to a trace.
Our SDKs will also link sessions,errors, and logs to their
respective traces.

The autoinjected attributes for traces can be seen in the table below.

suggestions for keys to filter on.

## Helpful Tips

To see all the spans of a specific trace, you can filter by `trace_id` to get a table view of the spans. You can also
click into the span to get more information, including a flame graph of the trace with all its spans.

Use `secure_session_id EXISTS` to only see spans that are tied to a session.

Use time suffixes, such as `s`, `ms` and `us` to help filter out for span durations. For example, use `duration>1s` to find
all spans that were longer than 1 second.
