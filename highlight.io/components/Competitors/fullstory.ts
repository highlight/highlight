In contrast, Fullstory primarily focuses on experience insight and funnels, which can be more useful to product and marketing teams.',

Instead, they offer custom pricing plans tailored to the specific needs of each organization, and users are encouraged to connect with their sales team. At Highlight.io, we are fundamentally against requiring a sales person to block you from using our product. Users can start for free and get their first 500 sessions and 1,000 errors per month for free. The tool also provides unlimited seats for all plans, including the free plan.`,
