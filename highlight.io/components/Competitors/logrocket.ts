				Lastly, the fact that [Highlight.io](https://highlight.io) is open source makes it easy to integrate and build your own tools on-top of it, an advantage closed-source products like LogRocket can\'t offer.

Plus, our community keeps pushing us to do more, so we're constantly adding new apps and integrations. We work hard to keep Highlight.io ahead of the curve, and we're not afraid to show off our secret sauce.",

Along with recording user sessions, Highlight.io also captures logs and errors, providing developers with a comprehensive view of their entire stack. In contrast, LogRocket primarily focuses on session replay and product analytics, which can be more useful to product folks. With its more comprehensive approach, Highlight.io can help developers identify and resolve issues more efficiently and effectively.',
