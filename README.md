## Highlight is the open-source, fullstack monitoring platform.

How many times have you heard the term prometheus or grafana or open telemetry? And how many times have you not given a f***? [note that we love these tools, we just think developers shouldn't have to worry about them ðŸ™‚]

Highlight is a monitoring tool for the next generation of developers (like you!). Unlike the age-old, outdated tools on the market, we want to build a [cohesive](#cohesion) and [modern](#for-todays-developer) monitoring product, something we wished WE had. 

This means making Highlight as easy as:
```javascript
import { H } from 'highlight.run'

H.init(
	'<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>'
)
```

Read more about our [philsophy below](#product-philsophy).


## Mission

Highlight gives you the tools to **uncover, prevent, and resolve** issues, so you can ship with more confidence than ever.
