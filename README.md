## Highlight is the open-source, fullstack monitoring platform.

Highlight is a monitoring tool for the next generation of developers (like you!). Unlike the age-old, outdated tools on the market, we want to build a [cohesive](#cohesion) and [modern](#for-todays-developer) monitoring product, something we wished WE had. 

How many times have you heard the term prometheus or grafana or loki? And how many times have you wondered why they were relevant? [note that we love these tools, we just think developers shouldn't have to worry about them üôÇ]

This means making Highlight as easy as:
```javascript
import { H } from 'highlight.run'

H.init(
	'<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>'
)
```

## Our Mission

Our missiong to help you ship with more confidence than ever. We do this by giving you the tools you need to **uncover, prevent, and resolve** issues in your web app.

## Our Values

### Building in Public
We strive to build in public in every way we can.  

### Cohesion
People may think that we're building multiple products (session replay, error monitoring, etc..). But we see it as one. Whenever we build something knew, we prioritize making it operate seemlessly with everything else.

### For Today's Developer
Who really cares about grafana or loki or the elk stack? We don't. Highlight is built for developers that want to DEVELOP. Leave the monitoring stuff to us üëç.
