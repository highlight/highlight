# [highlight.io](https://highlight.io): The open-source, fullstack monitoring platform.

highlight.io is a monitoring tool for the next generation of developers (like you!). Unlike the age-old, outdated tools out there, we aim to build a [cohesive](#we-build-a-cohesive-product), [modern](#we-build-for-todays-developer) and [fully-featured](#features) monitoring solution, something we wished WE had. And it's all open source :)

At a high level, highlight.io's feature set is:
- [Session Replay](#session-replay-understand-why-bugs-happen)
- [Error Monitoring](#error-monitoring-understand-what-bugs-are-happening)
- [Logging](#logging)

We strive to make highlight.io as easy to install as a few lines of code in any environment.

Read more about our [features](#features), [values](#our-values) and [mission](#our-mission) below, and get started at https://highlight.io today!

## Get started

### Hosted highlight.io (free to get started!)

The fastest and most reliable way to get started with highlight.io is signing up for free at [app.highlight.io](https://app.highlight.io). After making an account, getting started is as easy as installing the [client SDK snippet](https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/overview#For-your-frontend).

### Hobby self-hosted

Deploy a hobby instance in one line on Linux with Docker (we recommend at least 8GB of RAM, 4 CPUs, and 64 GB of disk space):

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/highlight/highlight
# or `git submodule update --init --recursive` on git < 2.13
cd docker && ./run-hobby.sh
```

After a brief frontend load time, the app should be accessible at https://localhost:3000

Good for <10k sessions and <50k errors ingested monthly. See our  [docs for more info and limitations](https://www.highlight.io/docs/general/company/open-source/hosting/self-host-hobby).

[Read a full list of highlight.io features](https://highlight.io/docs).

## SDKs

All of our SDKs for highlight.io can be found in the `sdk` [directory](https://github.com/highlight/highlight/tree/main/sdk). To get started with these SDKs, we recommend the [getting started guide](https://www.highlight.io/docs/getting-started/overview) in our docs.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to support developers like you in shipping with confidence. We do this by giving you the tools you need to **uncover, resolve, and prevent** issues in your web app.

## Our Values

### We build in public.

We strive to build in public in every way we can. This means that what we built, what we're building, and what we plan to build is shared with the world.

### We build a cohesive product.

People may think that we're building multiple products (session replay, error monitoring, etc..). But we see it as one. Before we build anything new, we prioritize making it operate seemlessly with everything else.

### We build for today's developer.

If you're building software, why should you care about grafana or loki or the elk stack? highlight.io is built for developers that want to **develop**. Leave the monitoring stuff to us üëç.
