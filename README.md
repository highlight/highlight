## Highlight: The open-source, fullstack monitoring platform.

Highlight is a monitoring tool for the next generation of developers (like you!). Unlike the age-old, outdated tools out there, we aim to build a [cohesive](#cohesion), [modern](#for-todays-developer) and [fully-featured](#features) monitoring solution, something we wished WE had. And it's all open source :)

In everything that we do, we strive to make Highlight as easy to install as a few lines of code in any environment. Read more about our [values](#our-values) and [mission](#our-mission) below.

## Get started

### Hosted Highlight (free to get started!)

The fastest and most reliable way to get started with Highlight is signing up for free at [app.highlight.io](https://app.highlighthighlight.io).

### Hobby self-hosted

Deploy a hobby instance in one line on Linux with Docker (recommended 32GB memory):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/highlight/highlight
cd docker && docker compose up -d --build
```

Good for <10k sessions and <50k errors ingested monthly. See our [docs for more info and limitations](https://highlight.io/docs/company/open-source/self-host-hobby).

### Enterprise self-hosted

See our [enterprise self-hosted docs](https://highlight.io/docs/company/open-source/self-host-enterprise) to deploy a scalable, production-ready instance with support from our team.

## Features
### Session Replay: Understand how users interact with your web app and WHY errors are happening.
- **Dom-based High-fidelity Replay**: Replay every interaction and dom change that happened in a given browser session (powered by https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb)
- **Outgoing Network Requests**: See all the network requests (and their contents) in a given session to reproduce the data that was sent/received by your frontend -> [docs](https://www.highlight.io/docs/session-replay/recording-network-requests-and-responses)
- **Console logs**: Analyze the logs printed (`console.error`, `console.log`, etc..) to the console from your frontend -> [docs](https://www.highlight.io/docs/session-replay/console-messages)
- **Embedded Error Monitoring**: See the errors associated with a given session to understand what the user was doing leading up to them.
- **Session Comments**: Comment on errors to communicate with your team on user frustration, bugs, and more! -> [docs](https://www.highlight.io/docs/product-features/comments)
- **Integrations with your favorite tools** -> [docs](https://highlight.io/docs/integrations)

- **Customizable Alerting Rules**: Customize how often alerts are sent to your tools (slack, discord, etc..) for errors thrown in Highlight  -> [docs](https://www.highlight.io/docs/product-features/alerts)

- **Embedded Session Replay**: See all of the sessions associated with a given error.
- **SDK Support**: Support for a long (and growing!) list of [SDKs](#sdks).
- **Integrations with your favorite tools** -> [docs](https://highlight.io/docs/integrations)

### Logging
Our logging product is still in beta, but please [message "Vadim" or "Jay" in discord](https://highlight.io) if you'd like a sneak peak of what we're building. We'd love for you to try an early version to share feedback.

### More?! Metrics? Traces? Merch?
Have an idea for what we should build next? Please share our [community](https://community.highlight.io) or via a Github Issue!

### Data and infrastructure tools

## Our Mission

Our mission is to help you ship with more confidence than ever. We do this by giving you the tools you need to **uncover, resolve, and prevent** issues in your web app.

## Our Values

### We build in public.

We strive to build in public in every way we can. This means that what we built, what we're building, and what we plan to build is shared with the world.

### We build a cohesive product.

People may think that we're building multiple products (session replay, error monitoring, etc..). But we see it as one. Before we build anything new, we prioritize making it operate seemlessly with everything else.

### We build for today's developer.

If you're building software, why should you care about grafana or loki or the elk stack? Highlight is built for developers that want to **develop**. Leave the monitoring stuff to us üëç.
