Switches privacy settings from `enableStrictPrivacy` to `privacySetting`, which will have a `'default'` mode that uses common regex expressions and input names to obfuscate personally identifiable information. Strict privacy mode is unchanged, and can be used by setting `privacySetting` to `'strict'`. No obfuscation can still be used by setting `privacySetting` to `'none'`.
