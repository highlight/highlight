  Use this generator to create new React components. Pass a path to the
  component and the name of the files will be inferred based on that.

  Usage:
    yarn g [option] react component [DIRECTORY]

  Example:
    Running `yarn g react component pages/About` will create component files
    inside `frontend/src/pages/About`.
